- To run geocollider: be in geocollider folder, then `bundle exec` desired .rb file in bin directory
    - `~/.rbenv/versions/2.5.0/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/bundler/gems/geocollider-something/`
    - Alternatively had to add these lines to the script and then `bundle update` to run via basic command:  
        `require 'rubygems'`  
        `require 'bundler/setup'`
