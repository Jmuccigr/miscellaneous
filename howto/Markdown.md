# What is it?

-----

- Markdown is a lightweight version of a *markup* language (get it?), designed after conventions that had mostly already been established, and meant to be easily readable and convertible into other markup languages (mainly HTML, the language of the web).

- Like other markup languages, it separates **form** from **content**.
	- Emphatic ≠ *italics*

## [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

What he says about it:

- text-to-HTML conversion tool
- write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format
- originally worked (and defined by a script, written in the Perl programming language

What he [says](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/markdown-the-syntax-you-probably-already-know/35295):

- almost anything you need to do, you can do in a plain text file

### So what?

1. it can be read by any computer or device
1. it’s future proof, since computers will always be able to read it
1. it can be synced to all your devices
1. it can be converted to virtually any format

# Some Examples


Paragraphs are just one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines.


- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco 
 
    laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

-----

- Headers are lines preceded by one or more hash marks `#`
	- \# Header
	- Add more hash marks to increase header level
		- \#\# Second Level
- Lists are lines preceded by hyphens `-`
- Emphasize words by surrounding them with `*` or `_`:
	- \*emphasis\*
		- This usually is translated as *italics*
- Strong emphasis needs two `*`: 
	- \*\*strong\*\*
		- This usually is translated as **bold**


# But my papers need more complex formatting!

## More to come...

Turns out Markdown can be combined with some other free tools to make it even more powerful and more useful for students and scholars.

I even made this slideshow in it!
