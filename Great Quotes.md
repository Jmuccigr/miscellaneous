<!--Management challenges for the 21st century-->

- Management exists for the sake of the institution's results. It has to start with the intended results and has to organize the resources of the institution to attain these results. It is the organ to make the institution, whether business, church, university, hospital or a battered women's shelter; capable of producing results outside itself. - p. 39
- If what looks like an opportunity does not advance the strategic goal of the institution, it is not an opportunity. It is a distraction. - p. 67
- In fact it is not possible to create tomorrow unless one first sloughs off yesterday. To maintain yesterday is always difficult and extremely time-consuming. [= "Organized abandonment"] - p. 74
- Organizations are no longer built on force. They are increasingly built on trust. Trust does not mean that people like one another. It means that people can trust one another. And this presupposes that people understand one another. Taking relationship responsibility is therefore an absolute necessity. It is a duty. - p. 187

#### [-@Drucker1998]
<!-- On the profession of management -->

- The Action  
Converting the decision into action is the fifth major element in the decision process. While thinking through the boundary conditions is the most difficult step in decision making, converting the decision into effective action is usually the most time-consuming one. Yet a decision will not become effective unless the action commitments have been built into it from the start. **In fact, no decision has been made unless carrying it out in specific steps has become someone's work assignment and responsibility. Until then, it is only a good intention.**  
The ﬂaw in so many policy statements, especially those of business, is that they contain no action commitment — to carry them out is no ones specific work and responsibility. - p. 28

- [On the Paradox of Choice]  
Most businesses-today's large U.S. corporations  are perhaps the worst offenders-pride themselves on being willing and able to supply any "specialty," to satisfy any demand for variety, even to stimulate such demands in the first place. And any number of businesses boast that they never, of their own free, abandon a product. As a result, most large companies typically end up with thousands of items in their product line-and all too frequently fewer than 20 really sell. However, these 20 items or less have to contribute revenues to carry the costs of the 9,999 nonsellers.  
Indeed, the basic problem of U.S. competitive strength in the world economy today may well be product clutter. If properly costed, the main lines in most of our industries will prove to be fully competitive, despite our high wage rates and our high tax burden. But we fritter away our competitive advantage in the volume products by subsidizing an enormous array of specialties, of which only a few recover their true cost. This, at least, is what I have found in such industries as steel and aluminum. And in electronics the competitive advantage of the Japanese portable transistor radio rests on little more than the Japanese concentration on a few models in this one line-as against the uncontrolled plethora of barely differentiated models in the U.S. manufacturers' lines.  
We are similarly profligate in this country with respect to staff activities. Our motto seems to be, Let's do a little bit of everything-personnel research, advanced engineering, customer analysis, international economics, operations research, public relations, and so on. As a result, we build enormous staffs, and yet do not concentrate enough effort in any one area to get very far. Nor do we know what to do to remedy the situation. The common way to control costs is still the one everybody knows to be ineffectual if not destructive: the "across-the-board-cut" by 15 percent. We have not really made a serious attempt to manage resources and pinpoint our efforts. Things are left to drift along. - p. 72
- [On the *Power law* - 90/10 rule]  
What is the principle? That, too, is well-known-at least as a general proposition. Business enterprise is not a phenomenon of nature but one of society. In a social situation, however, events are not distributed according to the normal distribution of a natural universe (that is, they are not distributed according to the U-shaped Gaussian curve). In a social situation a very small number of events-10 percent to 20 percent at most-account for 90 percent of all results, whereas the great majority of events account for 10 percent or less of the results. - p. 67
- Now most of them have learned that nonprofits need management even more than business does, precisely because **they lack the discipline of the bottom line**. - p. 132
- Finally, the single most important thing to remember about any enterprise is that there are no results inside its walls. The result of a business is a satisfied customer. The result of a hospital is a healed patient. The result of a school is a student who has learned something and puts it to work ten years later. Inside an enterprise, there are only cost centers. **Results exist only on the outside.** - p. 173
- To build achieving organizations, you must replace power with responsibility. -  p. 188
