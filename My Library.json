A total of 121 students enrolled in high school Latin I classes participated.

Comparison Group A received the list of words grouped randomly into three groups of seven. Comparison Group B and C received the list of words categorized by related definition into three groups of seven. Comparison Group C received a five minute imagery treatment prior to the immediate posttest. The Control Group X received neither a chunking technique nor an imagery treatment. Immediate and delayed posttests revealed significant differences between the groups.

By analysing the archaeological evidence for the form of early religious buildings and their role in ancient communities, it reconstructs a detailed history of early Latial and Etruscan religious architecture that brings together the buildings and the people who used them.00The first part of the study examines the processes by which religious buildings changed from huts and shrines to monumental temples, and explores apparent differences between these processes in Latium and Etruria. The second part analyses the broader architectural, religious, and topographical contexts of the first Etrusco-Italic temples alongside possible rationales for their introduction. The result is a new and extensive account of when, where, and why monumental cult buildings became features of early central Italic society and set precedents for the great temples of republican Rome.","collection-title":"Oxford monographs on classical archaeology","ISBN":"978-0-19-872207-6 0-19-872207-9","language":"English","note":"OCLC: 905487152","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Religious architecture in Latium and Etruria, c. 900-500 BC","author":[{"family":"Potts","given":"Charlotte R"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]}},

  {"id":"Rasmussen2014","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Clovis, with its distinctive biface, blade and osseous technologies, is the oldest widespread archaeological complex defined in North America, dating from 11,100 to 10,700 14C years before present (bp) (13,000 to 12,600 calendar years bp). Nearly 50 years of archaeological research point to the Clovis complex as having developed south of the North American ice sheets from an ancestral technology. However, both the origins and the genetic legacy of the people who manufactured Clovis tools remain under debate. It is generally believed that these people ultimately derived from Asia and were directly related to contemporary Native Americans. An alternative, Solutrean, hypothesis posits that the Clovis predecessors emigrated from southwestern Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum. Here we report the genome sequence of a male infant (Anzick-1) recovered from the Anzick burial site in western Montana. The human bones date to 10,705 ± 35 14C years bp (approximately 12,707-12,556 calendar years bp) and were directly associated with Clovis tools. We sequenced the genome to an average depth of 14.4× and show that the gene flow from the Siberian Upper Palaeolithic Mal/'ta population into Native American ancestors is also shared by the Anzick-1 individual and thus happened before 12,600 years bp. We also show that the Anzick-1 individual is more closely related to all indigenous American populations than to any other group. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that Anzick-1 belonged to a population directly ancestral to many contemporary Native Americans. Finally, we find evidence of a deep divergence in Native American populations that predates the Anzick-1 individual.","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature13025","ISSN":"0028-0836","issue":"7487","language":"en","page":"225-229","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The genome of a Late Pleistocene human from a Clovis burial site in western Montana","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v506/n7487/full/nature13025.html","volume":"506","author":[{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"Morten"},{"family":"Anzick","given":"Sarah L."},{"family":"Waters","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Skoglund","given":"Pontus"},{"family":"DeGiorgio","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Stafford Jr","given":"Thomas W."},{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Moltke","given":"Ida"},{"family":"Albrechtsen","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Doyle","given":"Shane M."},{"family":"Poznik","given":"G.

  {"id":"Dombrowski2014","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper charts the origins, trajectory, development, challenges, and conclusion of Project Bamboo, a humanities cyberinfrastructure initiative funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation between 2008 and 2012. Bamboo aimed to enhance arts and humanities research through the development of infrastructure and support for shared technology services. Its planning phase brought together scholars, librarians, and IT staff from a wide range of institutions, in order to gain insight into the scholarly practices Bamboo would support, and to build a community of future developers and users for Bamboo’s technical deliverables. From its inception, Bamboo struggled to define itself clearly and in a way that resonated with scholars, librarians, and IT staff alike. The early emphasis on a service-oriented architecture approach to supporting humanities research failed to connect with scholars, and the scope of Bamboo’s ambitions expanded to include scholarly networking, sharing ideas and solutions, and demonstrating how digital tools and methodologies can be applied to research questions. Funding constraints for Bamboo’s implementation phase led to the near-elimination of these community-oriented aspects of the project, but the lack of a shared vision that could supersede the individual interests of partner institutions resulted in a scope around which it was difficult to articulate a clear narrative. When Project Bamboo ended in 2012, it had failed to realize its most ambitious goals; this article explores the reasons for this, including technical approaches, communication difficulties, and challenges common to projects that bring together teams from different professional communities.","container-title":"Literary and Linguistic Computing","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqu026","ISSN":"0268-1145, 1477-4615","issue":"3","language":"en","page":"326-339","source":"CrossRef","title":"What Ever Happened to Project Bamboo?","URL":"http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1093/llc/fqu026","volume":"29","author":[{"family":"Dombrowski","given":"Quinn"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,17]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,1]]}},

To understand the comedy duo's lasting cultural implications, this article contextualizes the Laurel and Hardy relationship as a queered unit on-screen, proving truly relevant through a fuller understanding of the myths of fraternal brotherhood that flourished during the nineteenth century and the early twentieth. The fraternal lodge as an aggressively masculine performance space was challenged both by the development of a clearer heterosexual/homosexual cultural binary and by the instability of patriarchal structures during the first half of the twentieth century. As such, a queering of fraternity materializes in many Laurel and Hardy films and their spoofing of male institutions. This comedic attack especially appears in the motion picture that gives the appreciation society its name—Sons of the Desert, which targets fraternal lodges. By analyzing this film and its lasting cultural implications, we can understand what the appreciation society seems to have known all long: Laurel and Hardy prove relevant as long as fraternal myths define a US male identity.","call-number":"0000","container-title":"Camera Obscura: Feminism, Culture, and Media Studies","issue":"173","page":"97-129","title":"Laurel and Hardy Queer the Fraternity: The Comedy Duo and Heterosexual Brotherhood in Sons of the Desert","volume":"25","author":[{"family":"Balcerzak","given":"S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]}},

The current experiment tested the effects of moderate alcohol intoxication on a common creative problem solving task, the Remote Associates Test (RAT). Individuals were brought to a blood alcohol content of approximately .075, and, after reaching peak intoxication, completed a battery of RAT items. Intoxicated individuals solved more RAT items, in less time, and were more likely to perceive their solutions as the result of a sudden insight. Results are interpreted from an attentional control perspective.","container-title":"Consciousness and Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.concog.2012.01.002","ISSN":"1053-8100","issue":"1","page":"487-493","title":"Uncorking the muse: Alcohol intoxication facilitates creative problem solving","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012000037","volume":"21","author":[{"family":"Jarosz","given":"Andrew F."},{"family":"Colflesh","given":"Gregory J.H."},{"family":"Wiley","given":"Jennifer"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3]]}},

  {"id":"Mertens2009","type":"article-journal","abstract":"We propose a technique for fusing a bracketed exposure sequence into a high quality image, without converting to High dynamic range (HDR) first. Skipping the physically based HDR assembly step simplifies the acquisition pipeline. This avoids camera response curve calibration and is computationally efficient. It also allows for including flash images in the sequence. Our technique blends multiple exposures, guided by simple quality measures like saturation and contrast. This is done in a multiresolution fashion to account for the brightness variation in the sequence. The resulting image quality is comparable to existing tone mapping operators.","container-title":"Computer Graphics Forum","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01171.x","ISSN":"01677055, 14678659","issue":"1","language":"en","page":"161-171","source":"CrossRef","title":"Exposure Fusion: A Simple and Practical Alternative to High Dynamic Range Photography","title-short":"Exposure Fusion","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01171.x","volume":"28","author":[{"family":"Mertens","given":"T."},{"family":"Kautz","given":"J."},{"family":"Van Reeth","given":"F."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3]]}},

It is not an autonomous \"prime mover\" which accounts for developmental episodes. Even when population problems occur it is wrong to assume that they will generally stimulate developmental innovations. Development is more apt to be stimulated by more effective demand and perceptions of new possibilities. Stresses due to shortages may actually reduce effective demand and inhibit development. Better approaches for understanding development are suggested.","container-title":"American Anthropologist","ISSN":"0002-7294","issue":"3","page":"505-525","source":"JSTOR","title":"On Causes and Consequences of Ancient and Modern Population Changes","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/673393","volume":"77","author":[{"family":"Cowgill","given":"George L."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1975,9,1]]},"container-title-short":"AA"},

Dr Smith presents the most recent evidence from the whole region as well as Rome itself, and discusses the reliability and usefulness of the literary accounts of early Latium, as well as applying theoretical models of regional economy and archaeological interpretation.","ISBN":"0-19-815031-8 978-0-19-815031-2","language":"English","publisher":"Clarendon Press ; Oxford University Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Early Rome and Latium: economy and society c. 1000 to 500 BC","title-short":"Early Rome and Latium","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Christopher John"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1996]]},"publisher-place":"Oxford; New York"},

  {"id":"Wright1970","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The cultural sequence in the Taurus-Zagros mountain arc was marked about 11,000 years ago by a change from a hunting economy, in which the people lived primarily in caves, to a food-producing economy, with cultivation of cereal grains, domestication of animals, and occupation of open living sites. Pollen studies of lake sediments in the same region point to a change about 11,000 years ago from a cool steppe to a warm oak savanna and finally a woodland. Modern stands of wild barley, einkorn, and especially emmer are found today in the oak woodland. Perhaps they also immigrated 11,000 years ago along with the oak, and then were domesticated. The chronological coincidence of the climatic change and the agricultural revolution suggests that the former may have set the stage for the latter.","container-title":"BioScience","DOI":"10.2307/1295126","issue":"4","page":"210-217","source":"JSTOR","title":"Environmental Changes and the Origin of Agriculture in the near East","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1295126","volume":"20","author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"H.

  {"id":"Papadopoulos2002","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This article focuses on the early coinage of the Akhaian cities of South Italy -- Sybaris, Kroton, Metapontion, Kaulonia, Poseidonia -- against the backdrop of colonization. Minting an early and distinctive series of coins, these centres were issuing coinage well before their 'mother-cities', a phenomenon that has never been fully appreciated. With its origins in a colonial context, the Akhaian coinage of Magna Graecia not only differs from that of the early coin-minting states of the Greek mainland, it offers a case study that challenges long-held assumptions and potentially contributes to a better understanding of the origins of coinage. It does so by suggesting that coinage is much more than a symbol of authority and represents considerably more than just an abstract notion of sovereignty or hegemony. The images or emblems that the Akhaians of South Italy chose for their coins are those current in the contemporary cultural landscape of the historic Akhaians, but at the same time actively recall the world of the heroic Akhaians of the Bronze Age by referring to prehistoric measures of value. More than his, the vicissitudes of colonial and indigenous history in parts of South Italy in the Archaic period were not merely reflected in coinage, the coins themselves were central to the processes of transformation. By boldly minting -- constructing -- their identity on coinage, the Akhaians of South Italy chose money in order to create relations of dominance and to produce social orders that had not existed before.","container-title":"Cambridge Archaeological Journal","DOI":"10.1017/S00959774302000021","issue":"1","page":"21–55","title":"Minting Identity: Coinage, Ideology and the Economics of Colonization in Akhaina Magna Graecia","volume":"12","author":[{"family":"Papadopoulos","given":"John K"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]}},

  {"id":"Giumlia-Mair2001-1","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Ancient artisans were able to confer special colourings to their artefacts by applying particular techniques and treatments, which were lost in later centuries. They were also able to give copper based alloys the appearance of precious metals. Some of these special methods have been discovered and identified on ancient objects. The most famous of these alloys in Roman times was certainly Corinthian bronze, a copper alloy containing small amounts of precious metals, which acquired a purple-black or blue-black patination after a chemical bath. Several ancient texts, in particular Pliny and the alchemists, mention this precious material and give information on how it was produced. However, besides Corinthian bronze there were also other patinated alloys, which imitated the more precious version, and other colouring techniques, which could be achieved in different ways. The present paper reports on the author's latest research on special alloys in antiquity; several ancient examples of coloured metals and alloys are identified by scientific methods (ICP, AAS, XRD, SEM/EDX), and the problem of recognising the various surface treatments on archaeological objects is discussed.","container-title":"Surface Engineering","issue":"3","page":"223","title":"Alchemy and Surface Treatments in Antiquity","volume":"17","author":[{"family":"Giumlia-Mair","given":"Alessandra"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]}},

The DNA obtained was invariably of a low average molecular size and damaged by oxidative processes, which primarily manifest themselves as modifications of pyrimidines and sugar residues as well as baseless sites and intermolecular cross-links. This renders molecular cloning difficult. However, the polymerase chain reaction can be used to amplify and study short mitochondrial DNA sequences that are of anthropological and evolutionary significance.

  {"id":"Dicus2012","type":"thesis","abstract":"This dissertation uses the southern Etrurian sanctuary of Grasceta dei Cavallari in the Tolfa Mountains as a case-study to re-evaluate and challenge prevailing scholarship concerning the actors and agents participating in ritual behavior in fourth- to first-century BCE Italy. Through this period the dedication of anatomical terracotta votives—external body parts, internal organs—and terracotta heads was an extremely pervasive form of worship. Its spread is tied to Rome’s occupation of the peninsula, and its adoption by indigenous non-Roman peoples is seen as a hallmark of their acculturation under Rome’s hegemony. \n\tThe present conventional perspective neglects to differentiate practice from identity: because participation in the essentially Roman ritual was virtually pan-Italic, so too was a Romanized identity, regardless of traditional cultural backgrounds.  I argue that traditional local identities not only continued within the foreign rituals but also can be perceived and interpreted through the archaeological signatures of the votive offerings. I take as evidence the different formal styles of the votives at Grasceta dei Cavallari. Most notable are the schematic heads that are attributed to local workshops. Scholars depreciate this indigenous style as anomalous or as a naïve imitation of more “classical” Hellenic style products. I see, instead, a formal logic to the style. Informed by an entrenched and long-lived tradition within the Etruscan aesthetic repertoire, the style was ingrained in the habitus of the peoples. Its propagation into the anatomical votive tradition signals the agency of the Etruscans in maintaining visually their identity in the foreign cult.\n\tI disagree that the ritual tradition’s dominance mirrors the success of Rome to homogenize and Romanize the conquered peoples. There was no overarching imperial strategy guiding Roman expansion. Likewise, the native’s response to conquest extended beyond outright acceptance or resistance. Autonomy to evaluate imported customs enabled the conquered to adapt and refashion those which seemed advantageous. Thus, I argue that the tradition was taken up not to replace traditional belief systems, but to enhance them and provide novel ways for individuals and communities to manage their relationship with the divinities.","language":"en_US","publisher":"University of Michigan","source":"deepblue.lib.umich.edu","title":"Actors and Agents in Ritual Behavior: The Sanctuary at Grasceta dei Cavallari as a Case-Study of the E-L-C Votive Tradition in Republican Italy.","title-short":"Actors and Agents in Ritual Behavior","URL":"http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/91529","author":[{"family":"Dicus","given":"Kevin D'Arcy"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]}},

Studies have demonstrated the possibility of an extraordinary range of patronage and functions for these works. Indeed, the success of these works depended on their connection to a variety of Christian and Muslim audiences and on readings from various Christian and Muslim perspectives. This article explores, further, these multiple readings, highlighting the centrality of local culture in the production and reception of objects. A fully shared local visual culture explains the interchangeability of Christian and non-Christian motifs on these pieces of metalwork, with indigenous Christians and Muslims as participants and inhabitants of the same visual culture. The consideration of local identity for these objects also informs their Crusader patronage and reception. For the Crusaders, these works carried the imprimatur of authenticity and helped to shape the memory of their experience in the Holy Land.","call-number":"0000","container-title":"Gesta","issue":"2","page":"129-142","title":"Christian-Islamic Encounters on Thirteenth-Century Ayyubid Metalwork: Local Culture, Authenticity, and Memory","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25067100","volume":"43","author":[{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Eva R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]}},

  {"id":"Verga2002","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper presents the results of an historical and topographical survey carried out in the middle Tiber valley, more specifically in the Sabina Tiberina, in the area around Poggio Sommavilla. The survey focused particularly on the area under the present-day administration of the Comune of Stimigliano, with the aim of reconstructing the topographical layout of the Roman landscape. The field survey shed important new light on the nature of the archaic and Roman road network. In particular, as well as the Via Flaminia that runs along the western limits of the study area, another road was identified running in a broadly northeast-southwest direction, which appears to have formed the main trade route that served the area during both the archaic and Roman periods. Furthermore, the study of earlier maps, together with the evidence from the survey, has permitted the identification along the Tiber of a number of ancient ports, the positions of which were not known previously. It is interesting to note that the settlement pattern characteristic of the Iron Age, which favoured high plateaux overlooking the Tiber, continued into the archaic period. This appears to have had a significant impact on settlement of the Roman period, in that the earliest attested Roman villas in this area are those situated next to the Tiber. The development of the 'phenomenon of the villa' in the area of the Sabina Tiberina from the end of the Republican period (third to second centuries BC) is consistent with the results of studies in other parts of central Italy. The study of the pottery collected from settlements of the archaic period (Colle Rosetta) and the Roman period (San Sebastiano) confirms the importance of the Tiber as a trade route for commercial exchange.","call-number":"0002","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","page":"79-98","title":"L'assetto rurale in età arcaica ed in età romana del terrttorio di Poggio Sommavilla (Sabina Tiberina)","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40311044","volume":"70","author":[{"family":"Verga","given":"Flaminia"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},

  {"id":"Batterbury2008","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This article offers a critical perspective on the academic tenure system in the USA. Academic tenure is most frequently defended for the protection it affords freedom of speech in higher education, and it is attacked for its cost and lack of flexibility in a rapidly changing sector. The paper makes a third argument, that tenure sustains an unhealthy divide between tenured, untenured, and non-tenure-track staff members. It leads to differences in status, income, and job satisfaction that are inimical to basic principles of social justice. While financial considerations are a powerful factor in university efforts to constrain or challenge tenure, the maintenance of the tenure system and its use to control entry to permanent employment needs further examination. The author explores the system of ‘permanent’ contracts common in British and Australasian universities as an alternative for the USA – not because it benefits entrepreneurial university managers and administrators, but for its potential to offer a greater range of career positions for actual and potential staff members.","container-title":"Policy Futures in Education","DOI":"10.2304/pfie.2008.6.3.286","ISSN":"1478-2103","issue":"3","language":"en","page":"286-297","source":"CrossRef","title":"Tenure or Permanent Contracts in North American Higher Education?

  {"id":"Small2010","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Of 1,257 fragments of black-gloss ware found in the surface survey of San Felice, 56 can be classified by type and (on visual evidence) by fabric. The earliest are drinking vessels—\"Ionian\" type cups and \"Metapontine\" skyphoi—in use in the sixth century BC. During the fifth century they gave way to new types mostly made in Metapontum or Tarentum in imitation of Attic forms, especially skyphoi and jugs suitable for use in the symposium. They illustrate the hellenization of the site in this period. \"Salt cellars\" used in banqueting are common from the late fifth to the beginning of the third century, and show significant typological development. Some other pieces straddle the turn of the fourth/third centuries, but the absence of types most typical of the third century suggests that occupation of the site came to an end around the end of the fourth or beginning of the third century BC. Since San Felice is likely to have been a dependency of Botromagno/Silvium, which was sacked by the Romans in 306 BC, it is probable that the site was abandoned as a consequence of this event. A few later sherds are likely to be casual scatter from the Roman villa below the scarp of the plateau. In addition to its contribution to the history of the late Iron Age in this area, the study is important for understanding the background to the foundation of the villa and of the village of Vagnari situated in the valley below it.","container-title":"Mouseion: Journal of the Classical Association of Canada","DOI":"10.1353/mou.2010.0056","ISSN":"1913-5416","issue":"2","page":"243-280","source":"CrossRef","title":"The Black-gloss Pottery from the Iron Age Site of San Felice, South Italy","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/mouseion_journal_of_the_classical_association_of_canada/v010/10.2.small.html","volume":"10","author":[{"family":"Small","given":"Alastair"},{"family":"Small","given":"Carola"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,7,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]}},

  {"id":"Askin2016","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper examines the effect of status loss on organizations’ price-setting behavior. We predict, counter to current status theory and aligned with performance feedback theory, that a status decline prompts certain organizations to charge higher prices and that there are two kinds of organizations most prone to make such price increases: those with broad appeal across disconnected types of customers and those whose most strategically similar rivals have charged high prices previously. Using panel data from U.S. News & World Report’s annual rankings of private colleges and universities from 2005 to 2012, we model the effect of drops in rank that take a school below an aspiration level. We find that schools set tuition higher after a sharp decline in rank, particularly those that appeal widely to college applicants and whose rivals are relatively more expensive. This study presents a dynamic conception of status that differs from the prevailing view of status as a stable asset that yields concrete benefits. In contrast to past work that has assumed that organizations passively experience negative effects when their status falls, our results show that organizations actively respond to status loss. Status is a performance-related goal for such producers, who may increase prices as they work to recover lost ground after a status decline.","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0001839216629671","ISSN":"0001-8392, 1930-3815","language":"en","page":"1-37","source":"asq.sagepub.com","title":"Status-Aspirational Pricing The “Chivas Regal” Strategy in U.S. Higher Education, 2006–2012","URL":"http://asq.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/01/29/0001839216629671","author":[{"family":"Askin","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Bothner","given":"Matthew S."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,29]]},"container-title-short":"ASQ"},

  {"id":"Ammerman1991","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The article presents a distinctive group of terracotta figurines from Paestum portraying a naked standing goddess. Excavations at the extramural sanctuary in the locality known today as Santa Venera have led to the recovery of 21 such figurines, which date to the first half of the sixth century B. C. While the technology used in producing the moldmade figurines can be traced to workshops at Metaponto, the image of the naked goddess itself is almost never represented among the vast corpora of terracottas found at other Greek sites in the West. The source of the imagery is traced to the eastern Mediterranean, where a naked standing goddess is more commonly observed. In the Aegean, the iconography in question can be associated with Phoenician Astarte or Cypriot Aphrodite. In places where the Greeks and Phoenicians came in contact with one another, there is often an overlapping in the persona of the two deities; in addition, a similar conflation sometimes occurs between these two deities and Hera. For the sanctuary at Santa Venera, the argument is thus made, based on the presence of figurines of the naked goddess, that the original patron deity of the cult was related to Phoenician Astarte or Cypriot Aphrodite. Later in the sanctuary's life, during the Roman period, inscriptions indicate that the cult patron was Venus.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.2307/505723","issue":"2","page":"203-230","title":"The Naked Standing Goddess: A Group of Archaic Terracotta Figurines from Paestum","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/505723","volume":"95","author":[{"family":"Ammerman","given":"Rebecca Miller"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1991]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

  {"id":"Montague1993","type":"article-journal","abstract":"PURPOSE. To determine whether significant correlations existed among quantitative and qualitative predictors of students' academic success and quantitative outcomes of such success over a 12-year period in a small university's premedical program. METHOD. A database was assembled from information on the 199 graduates who earned BS degrees in biology from Barry University's School of Natural and Health Sciences from 1980 through 1991. The quantitative variables were year of BS degree, total score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), various measures of undergraduate grade-point averages (GPAs), and total score on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT); and the qualitative variables were minority (54% of the students) or majority status and transfer (about one-third of the students) or nontransfer status. The statistical methods were multiple analysis of variance and stepwise multiple regression. RESULTS. Statistically significant positive correlations were found among SAT total scores, final GPAs, biology GPAs versus nonbiology GPAs, and MCAT total scores. These correlations held for transfer versus nontransfer students and for minority versus majority students. Over the 12-year period there were significant fluctuations in mean MCAT scores. CONCLUSION. The students' SAT scores and GPAs proved to be statistically reliable predictors of MCAT scores, but the minority or majority status and the transfer or nontransfer status of the students were statistically insignificant.","container-title":"Acad Med","issue":"4","page":"306-308","title":"A twelve-year profile of students' SAT scores, GPAs, and MCAT scores from a small university's premedical program","volume":"68","author":[{"family":"Montague","given":"J.R."},{"family":"Frei","given":"J.K."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]}},

At first glance, tomb painting has no obvious connection with the Early Iron Age or Villanovan period (tenth/ninth--eighth centuries BC), when burial in shaft or trench graves predominated. Nevertheless, some links can be suggested with Villanovan house urns, which reinforce the point that indigenous traditions merit greater consideration than is usual in discussions of Etruscan artistic and cultural development.

  {"id":"Alsalam2004","type":"report","abstract":"The cost of four years of undergraduate education, including living expenses, now averages nearly $80,000 at public colleges and over $100,000 at many private institutions. Tuition and fees have risen steadily since 1980, fueling concern that college is becoming prohibitively expensive for many families. This Congressional Budget Office (CBO) paper--prepared at the request of the Senate Budget Committee--estimates how much students and families paid in college costs in the 1999-2000 academic year after accounting for all of that aid. Because a primary purpose of financial aid is to level the playing field among students and because the cost of college differs significantly for different types of institutions (for example, two-year public and four-year private schools), CBO breaks down its estimates by family income group and type of college. Several findings from CBO's analysis suggest that governmental and other nonfamily assistance makes up a particularly large share of financial support for students from low-income families. Reconciling Means of Financing with Tuition and Nontuition Expenditures is appended.

  {"id":"Marchiori2009","type":"article-journal","abstract":"ABSTRACT Le pitture medievali nella chiesa di Santa Maria in Pallara hanno ricevuto poca attenzione da parte degli studiosi, forse per via dell'incertezza della loro datazione; infatti non si possiede nessuna indipendente documentazione letteraria per la loro realizzazione. Tradizionalmente datati al X secolo, le pitture mostrano un'iconografia più comune nei contesti del XII e XIII secolo, una rappresentazione di Apostoli seduti sulle spalle dei Profeti, che senza dubbio contribuiscono alla loro dimenticanza, visto che i monumenti più tardi sono ben documentati. Comunque, l'iconografia deriva dalle tradizioni romane della decorazione ecclesiastica, tradizioni che possono essere utilizzate in un'analisi delle pitture al fine di arrivare ad una datazione indipendente basata solo sulla loro forma e contenuto. Seguendo una metodologia sviluppata da John Osbornc per la datazione di pitture medievali prive di documentazione a Roma, questo articolo analizza i criteri obicttivi di datazione delle pitture di Santa Maria in Pallara; tali criteri sono la messa in opera, la funzione, il soggetto, le iscrizioni e la tecnica pittorica. Simili analisi suggeriscono che per le pitture è possibile una data al X secolo, che sono ben classificate nella storia della tecnica pittorica di Roma tra monumenti sicuramente datati al IX secolo e quelli datati all'XI e XII secolo.","call-number":"0000","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.1017/S0068246200000088","page":"225-255","title":"Medieval wall painting in the church of Santa Maria in Pallara, Rome: the use of objective dating criteria","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0068246200000088","volume":"77","author":[{"family":"Marchiori","given":"Laura"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},

L'elevata presenza attribuita ai Micenei ha incoraggiato la teoria che furono loro ad innescare gli sviluppi sociali sperimentati in Italia alla fine dell'età del Bronzo. Concentrandosi sull'evidenza ceramica, questo contributo assume una posizione minimalista, sostenendo che le relazioni tra i Micenei e le genti d'Italia erano infrequenti, di piccola scala e avevano, al massimo, un impatto circoscritto in aree limitate. Comunque, esiste una marcata variabilità nella distribuzione della ceramica micenea in Italia, sia geografica sia cronologica, con nessuna chiara coerenza nelle azioni e risposte micenee e italiche.L'evidenza suggerisce che i Micenei non trassero molto giovamento dalle visite, che per questo divennero meno frequenti. In aggiunta i Micenei non ebbero la capacità di fare più che commerci di oggetti e prodotti con l'Italia, e così ebbero scarsa influenza su altri settori della vita.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.1017/S0068246200000398","page":"1-34","title":"The Mycenaeans in Italy: a minimalist position","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0068246200000398","volume":"76","author":[{"family":"Blake","given":"Emma"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},

  {"id":"Muccigrosso1998","type":"thesis","abstract":"The late fourth and early third centuries B.C. witnessed important changes in the internal political structure of the Roman state as well as the rise of Rome to dominance of the Italian peninsula. At the same time, a number of different forms of public display became popular in the city, including temple foundations, building decoration and funerary games. In order to understand the relationship between these two phenomena, I undertake an examination of the ancient literary evidence for this period, emphasizing the survival of mid-Republican texts to later times. I then turn to the career of Appius Claudius Caecus, one of the major political figures of that time. Based on the results of this analysis, I apply a recently developed anthropological model of group activity, known as factionalism, to Agpius and the men associated with him in the sources. This model posits the existence of groups of men, bound together in order to achieve various personal political goals, and working within the existing political structure, though often engaged in innovative behavior which results in the evolution of their political system. In the case of Appius and his allies and opponents, factionalism is able to account for several of the activities of public display in which they engage, which appear not to be isolated, but instead direct responses to one another. More broadly, it suggests that the introduction of new agents into Roman politics during the fourth century is responsible for the rise in public displays. The model is also successfully applied to other examples of display centering on the figure of Q. Fabius Maximus Rullianus, one of the men consistently opposed to Appius. I also suggest that factional competition can be used to explain the location of various temples around Republican Rome, and that such competition may have great explanatory power for many observed displays throughout the Republic. The existence of factionally driven innovation and competition may also help explain the circumstances leading to the downfall of the Republic.","call-number":"0000","language":"Eng","note":"Ph.D.; University of Michigan","publisher":"University of Michigan","title":"Factional competition and monumental construction in mid-Republican Rome","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/docview/304443512","author":[{"family":"Muccigrosso","given":"John D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"publisher-place":"United States -- Michigan"},

Here, we show how the systematic combinatorial analysis of the numerals appearing on ancient southern Etrurian dice dated from the eighth to the third centuries bc, together with the careful comparison of the results with the only two existing dice carrying the alphabetical translations of the numerals conserved at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Paris, finally allows unambiguous mathematical resolution of the linguistic riddle, allowing the firm attribution of the numeral 6 to the graphical value huth and 4 to sa. Combinatorial analysis of the numerals distribution on the six faces of the die shows that only two of the 15 possible numerical combinations were actually in use in southern Etruria, and that during the fifth century bc there was a marked shift from the typical (1–2, 3–4, 5–6) combination used in the early seventh- to fifth-century bc dice to the (1–6, 2–5, 3–4) combination used at later times and still largely adopted today.

  {"id":"Gardner2007","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Context  Popular diets, particularly those low in carbohydrates, have challenged current recommendations advising a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for weight loss. Potential benefits and risks have not been tested adequately.Objective  To compare 4 weight-loss diets representing a spectrum of low to high carbohydrate intake for effects on weight loss and related metabolic variables.Design, Setting, and Participants  Twelve-month randomized trial conducted in the United States from February 2003 to October 2005 among 311 free-living, overweight/obese (body mass index, 27-40) nondiabetic, premenopausal women.Intervention  Participants were randomly assigned to follow the Atkins (n = 77), Zone (n = 79), LEARN (n = 79), or Ornish (n = 76) diets and received weekly instruction for 2 months, then an additional 10-month follow-up.Main Outcome Measures  Weight loss at 12 months was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included lipid profile (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels), percentage of body fat, waist-hip ratio, fasting insulin and glucose levels, and blood pressure. Outcomes were assessed at months 0, 2, 6, and 12. The Tukey studentized range test was used to adjust for multiple testing.Results  Weight loss was greater for women in the Atkins diet group compared with the other diet groups at 12 months, and mean 12-month weight loss was significantly different between the Atkins and Zone diets (P<.05). Mean 12-month weight loss was as follows: Atkins, −4.7 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], −6.3 to −3.1 kg), Zone, −1.6 kg (95% CI, −2.8 to −0.4 kg), LEARN, −2.6 kg (−3.8 to −1.3 kg), and Ornish, −2.2 kg (−3.6 to −0.8 kg). Weight loss was not statistically different among the Zone, LEARN, and Ornish groups. At 12 months, secondary outcomes for the Atkins group were comparable with or more favorable than the other diet groups.Conclusions  In this study, premenopausal overweight and obese women assigned to follow the Atkins diet, which had the lowest carbohydrate intake, lost more weight and experienced more favorable overall metabolic effects at 12 months than women assigned to follow the Zone, Ornish, or LEARN diets. While questions remain about long-term effects and mechanisms, a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet may be considered a feasible alternative recommendation for weight loss.Trial Registration  clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00079573","container-title":"The Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.297.9.969","issue":"9","page":"969 -977","title":"Comparison of the Atkins, Zone, Ornish, and LEARN Diets for Change in Weight and Related Risk Factors Among Overweight Premenopausal Women","URL":"http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/297/9/969.abstract","volume":"297","author":[{"family":"Gardner","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Kiazand","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Alhassan","given":"Sofiya"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Soowon"},{"family":"Stafford","given":"Randall S."},{"family":"Balise","given":"Raymond R."},{"family":"Kraemer","given":"Helena C."},{"family":"King","given":"Abby C."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,3,7]]},"container-title-short":"JAMA"},

Participants were enrolled starting July 18, 2000, and randomized to 4 popular diet groups until January 24, 2002.Intervention  A total of 160 participants were randomly assigned to either Atkins (carbohydrate restriction, n=40), Zone (macronutrient balance, n=40), Weight Watchers (calorie restriction, n=40), or Ornish (fat restriction, n=40) diet groups. After 2 months of maximum effort, participants selected their own levels of dietary adherence.Main Outcome Measures  One-year changes in baseline weight and cardiac risk factors, and self-selected dietary adherence rates per self-report.Results  Assuming no change from baseline for participants who discontinued the study, mean (SD) weight loss at 1 year was 2.1 (4.8) kg for Atkins (21 [53%] of 40 participants completed, P = .009), 3.2 (6.0) kg for Zone (26 [65%] of 40 completed, P = .002), 3.0 (4.9) kg for Weight Watchers (26 [65%] of 40 completed, P < .001), and 3.3 (7.3) kg for Ornish (20 [50%] of 40 completed, P = .007). Greater effects were observed in study completers. Each diet significantly reduced the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio by approximately 10% (all P<.05), with no significant effects on blood pressure or glucose at 1 year. Amount of weight loss was associated with self-reported dietary adherence level (r = 0.60; P<.001) but not with diet type (r = 0.07; P = .40). For each diet, decreasing levels of total/HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and insulin were significantly associated with weight loss (mean r = 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39, respectively) with no significant difference between diets (P = .48, P = .57, P = .31, respectively).Conclusions  Each popular diet modestly reduced body weight and several cardiac risk factors at 1 year. Overall dietary adherence rates were low, although increased adherence was associated with greater weight loss and cardiac risk factor reductions for each diet group.","container-title":"JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.293.1.43","issue":"1","page":"43 -53","title":"Comparison of the Atkins, Ornish, Weight Watchers, and Zone Diets for Weight Loss and Heart Disease Risk Reduction","URL":"http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/293/1/43.abstract","volume":"293","author":[{"family":"Dansinger","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Gleason","given":"Joi Augustin"},{"family":"Griffith","given":"John L."},{"family":"Selker","given":"Harry P."},{"family":"Schaefer","given":"Ernst J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,1,5]]}},

Over 50,000 college courses whose teachers used the Student Instructional Report II were analyzed. In addition to the two primary independent variables, the regression analyses included 8 subject area groupings and controlled for such factors as class size, teaching method, and student perceived learning outcomes in the course. Learn- ing outcomes had a large positive effect on student evaluations of instructions, as it should. After controlling for learning outcomes, expected grades generally did not affect student evaluations. In fact, contrary to what some faculty think, courses in natural sciences with expected grades of A were rated lower, not higher.

  {"id":"Schrodt13","type":"article","abstract":"A combination of technological change, methodological drift and a certain degree of intellectual sloth, particularly with respect to philosophy of science, has allowed contemporary quantitative political analysis to accumulate a series of dysfunctional habits that have rendered much of contemporary research more or less meaningless. I identify these “seven deadly sins” as\n• Garbage can models that ignore the effects of collinearity;\n• Pre-scientific explanation in the absence of prediction;\n• Excessive reanalysis of a small number of data sets;\n• Using complex methods without understanding the underlying assumptions;\n• Interpreting frequentist statistics as if they were Bayesian;\n• A linear statistical monoculture which fails to consider alternative structures;\n• Confusing statistical controls and experimental controls.\nThe answer to these problems is not to abandon quantitative approaches, but rather with solid, thoughtful, original work driven by an appreciation of both theory and data. The paper closes with suggestions for changes in current practice that might serve to ameliorate some of these problems.","title":"Seven Deadly Sins of Contemporary Quantitative Political Analysis","URL":"http://7ds.parusanalytics.com/Schrodt.7DS.JPR.May13.pdf","author":[{"family":"Schrodt","given":"Philip A."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,22]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[13,5,31]]}},

  {"id":"Burkert1992","type":"book","abstract":"The rich and splendid culture of the ancient Greeks has often been described as emerging like a miracle from a genius of its own, owing practically nothing to its neighbors. Walter Burkert offers a decisive argument against that distorted view, replacing it with a balanced picture of the archaic period \"in which, under the influence of the Semitic East, Greek culture began its unique flowering, soon to assume cultural hegemony in the Mediterranean.\" Burkert focuses on the \"orientalizing\" century 750-650 B.C., the period of Assyrian conquest, Phoenician commerce, and Greek exploration of both East and West, when not only eastern skills and images but also the Semitic art of writing were transmitted to Greece. He tracks the migrant craftsmen who brought the Greeks new techniques and designs, the wandering seers and healers teaching magic and medicine, and the important Greek borrowings from Near Eastern poetry and myth. Drawing widely on archaeological, textual, and historical evidence, he demonstrates that eastern models significantly affected Greek literature and religion in the Homeric age.","ISBN":"0-674-64363-1 978-0-674-64363-5","language":"English","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The Orientalizing revolution: Near Eastern influence on Greek culture in the early archaic age","title-short":"The orientalizing revolution","author":[{"family":"Burkert","given":"Walter"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1992]]},"publisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass."},

  {"id":"Martiniano2016","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The purported migrations that have formed the peoples of Britain have been the focus of generations of scholarly controversy. However, this has not benefited from direct analyses of ancient genomes. Here we report nine ancient genomes (~1 ×) of individuals from northern Britain: seven from a Roman era York cemetery, bookended by earlier Iron-Age and later Anglo-Saxon burials. Six of the Roman genomes show affinity with modern British Celtic populations, particularly Welsh, but significantly diverge from populations from Yorkshire and other eastern English samples. They also show similarity with the earlier Iron-Age genome, suggesting population continuity, but differ from the later Anglo-Saxon genome. This pattern concords with profound impact of migrations in the Anglo-Saxon period. Strikingly, one Roman skeleton shows a clear signal of exogenous origin, with affinities pointing towards the Middle East, confirming the cosmopolitan character of the Empire, even at its northernmost fringes.","container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms10326","language":"en","page":"10326","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genomic signals of migration and continuity in Britain before the Anglo-Saxons","URL":"http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160119/ncomms10326/full/ncomms10326.html","volume":"7","author":[{"family":"Martiniano","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Caffell","given":"Anwen"},{"family":"Holst","given":"Malin"},{"family":"Hunter-Mann","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Montgomery","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Müldner","given":"Gundula"},{"family":"McLaughlin","given":"Russell L."},{"family":"Teasdale","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Rheenen","given":"Wouter","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Veldink","given":"Jan H."},{"family":"Berg","given":"Leonard H.","dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Hardiman","given":"Orla"},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Maureen"},{"family":"Roskams","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Oxley","given":"John"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Colleen"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Mark G."},{"family":"Barnes","given":"Ian"},{"family":"McDonnell","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Collins","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Bradley","given":"Daniel G."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,28]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,19]]}},

  {"id":"Harvey2016","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Collagen is the dominant organic component of bone and is intimately locked within the hydroxyapatite structure of this ubiquitous biomaterial that dominates archaeological and palaeontological assemblages. Radiocarbon analysis of extracted collagen is one of the most common approaches to dating bone from late Pleistocene or Holocene deposits, but dating is relatively expensive compared to other biochemical techniques. Numerous analytical methods have previously been investigated for the purpose of screening out samples that are unlikely to yield reliable dates including histological analysis, UV-stimulated fluorescence and, most commonly, the measurement of percentage nitrogen (%N) and ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N). Here we propose the use of collagen fingerprinting (also known as  Zoo archaeology by  M ass  S pectrometry, or ZooMS, when applied to species identification) as an alternative screening method for radiocarbon dating, due to its ability to provide information on collagen presence and quality, alongside species identification. The method was tested on a series of sub-fossil bone specimens from cave systems on Cayman Brac (Cayman Islands), chosen due to the observable range in diagenetic alteration, and in particular, the extent of mineralisation. Six  14 C dates, of 18 initial attempts, were obtained from remains of extinct hutia,  Capromys  sp. (Rodentia; Capromyidae), recovered from five distinct caves on Cayman Brac, and ranging from 393 ± 25 to 1588 ± 26 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP). All of the bone samples that yielded radiocarbon dates generated excellent collagen fingerprints, and conversely those that gave poor fingerprints also failed dating. Additionally, two successfully fingerprinted bone samples were screened out from a set of 81. Both subsequently generated  14 C dates, demonstrating successful utilisation of ZooMS as an alternative screening mechanism to identify bone samples that are suitable for  14 C analysis.","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0150650","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","page":"e0150650","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Collagen Fingerprinting: A New Screening Technique for Radiocarbon Dating Ancient Bone","title-short":"Collagen Fingerprinting","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150650","volume":"11","author":[{"family":"Harvey","given":"Virginia L."},{"family":"Egerton","given":"Victoria M."},{"family":"Chamberlain","given":"Andrew T."},{"family":"Manning","given":"Phillip L."},{"family":"Buckley","given":"Michael"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,11]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,3]]},"container-title-short":"PLOS ONE"},

  {"id":"Robinson1992","type":"book","abstract":"The population of ancient Rome at its peak exceeded that of any previous western city, or any that came after it until the Industrial Revolution. The requirements for its running--to keep inhabitants fed and provided with water, drainage and entertainment, to enable the people to move about freely and in relative safety, to facilitate a reasonable harmony with their neighbours--meant that a pragmatic system of administrative law was needed. This book describes the legal aspects of urbanism, of the functioning of Rome as a city. O.F. Robinson begins by introducing the purely physical aspect of Rome--its population and boundaries. An overview of town planning is followed by an in-depth treatment of building controls, public works, streets and traffic. The Tiber, the main river in Rome, was central to life in the City. Its bridges and sewers, its employment as a transport system, its relationship to the water supply, and its other uses are discussed in detail. This provides the background for an analysis of public health and safety. Additionally, the book focuses on services such as food distribution, entertainment such as the theatre and gladiatorial games, and the forces of law and order. Ancient Rome: City Planning and Administration is a comprehensive survey of the running of a great city without modern technology. It will be of considerable interest to Roman lawyers, historians and archaeologists, as well as those concerned with current local government.","ISBN":"0-415-02234-7 978-0-415-02234-7 0-415-10618-4 978-0-415-10618-4","language":"English","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Ancient Rome: city planning and administration","title-short":"Ancient Rome","author":[{"family":"Robinson","given":"O.

  {"id":"Brennan2016","type":"article-journal","abstract":"American universities rely upon a large workforce of adjunct faculty—contract workers who receive low pay, no benefits, and no job security. Many news sources, magazines, and activists claim that adjuncts are exploited and should receive better pay and treatment. This paper never affirms nor denies that adjuncts are exploited. Instead, we show that any attempt to provide a significantly better deal faces unpleasant constraints and trade-offs. “Adjunct justice” would cost universities somewhere between an additional $15–50 billion per year. At most, universities can provide justice for a minority of adjuncts at the expense of the majority, as well as at the expense of poor students. Universities may indeed be exploiting adjuncts, but they cannot rectify this mistake without significant moral costs.","container-title":"Journal of Business Ethics","DOI":"10.1007/s10551-016-3013-1","ISSN":"0167-4544, 1573-0697","language":"en","page":"1-14","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Estimating the Cost of Justice for Adjuncts: A Case Study in University Business Ethics","title-short":"Estimating the Cost of Justice for Adjuncts","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-016-3013-1","author":[{"family":"Brennan","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Magness","given":"Phillip"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,17]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,11]]},"container-title-short":"J Bus Ethics"},

  {"id":"Cassidy2016","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The Neolithic and Bronze Age transitions were profound cultural shifts catalyzed in parts of Europe by migrations, first of early farmers from the Near East and then Bronze Age herders from the Pontic Steppe. However, a decades-long, unresolved controversy is whether population change or cultural adoption occurred at the Atlantic edge, within the British Isles. We address this issue by using the first whole genome data from prehistoric Irish individuals. A Neolithic woman (3343–3020 cal BC) from a megalithic burial (10.3× coverage) possessed a genome of predominantly Near Eastern origin. She had some hunter–gatherer ancestry but belonged to a population of large effective size, suggesting a substantial influx of early farmers to the island. Three Bronze Age individuals from Rathlin Island (2026–1534 cal BC), including one high coverage (10.5×) genome, showed substantial Steppe genetic heritage indicating that the European population upheavals of the third millennium manifested all of the way from southern Siberia to the western ocean. This turnover invites the possibility of accompanying introduction of Indo-European, perhaps early Celtic, language. Irish Bronze Age haplotypic similarity is strongest within modern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh populations, and several important genetic variants that today show maximal or very high frequencies in Ireland appear at this horizon. These include those coding for lactase persistence, blue eye color, Y chromosome R1b haplotypes, and the hemochromatosis C282Y allele; to our knowledge, the first detection of a known Mendelian disease variant in prehistory. These findings together suggest the establishment of central attributes of the Irish genome 4,000 y ago.","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1518445113","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"2","language":"en","page":"368-373","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Neolithic and Bronze Age migration to Ireland and establishment of the insular Atlantic genome","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/113/2/368","volume":"113","author":[{"family":"Cassidy","given":"Lara M."},{"family":"Martiniano","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Eileen M."},{"family":"Teasdale","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Mallory","given":"James"},{"family":"Hartwell","given":"Barrie"},{"family":"Bradley","given":"Daniel G."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"PMID":"26712024","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

  {"id":"Potts","type":"article-journal","abstract":"It is all too tempting to use Vitruvius’ De architectura to reconstruct the walls and columns of Etruscan temples now missing from the archaeological record. The Roman treatise contains a clear formula for the ground plan of a temple designed in accordance with the tuscanicae dispositiones, but that plan differs from those of many Etruscan cult buildings reconstructed on the basis of archaeological evidence. This article explores the resulting debate about what Vitruvius was actually describing and by extension his relevance for the study of Etruscan architecture. It shows that while Vitruvius should not be regarded as an authoritative source of information about Etruscan plans, this is less a consequence of his measurements than the way in which they are often interpreted. If the discrepancies between the literary and archaeological data are regarded not as errors but as signs of the intended function of the tuscanicae dispositiones, then it is possible to reconcile the divergent evidence for the arrangement of temple walls and columns in a manner consistent with modern architectural theory.","container-title":"Accordia Research Papers","page":"87-102","title":"Vitruvius and Etruscan Design","author":[{"family":"Potts","given":"Charlotte R."}]},

Senseney explores the earliest recognizable example of this architectural type, a lost porticus of the 160s BCE built by the victorious commander Gnaeus Octavius. Adrift toward Empire: The Lost Porticus Octavia in Rome and the Origins of the Imperial Fora adduces ancient testimony to aid our understanding of the purposes and formal appearance of this pivotal monument. While the author suggests that Octavius emulated a Hellenistic model, he does not posit that the patron necessarily sought to associate his triumph with those of his Greek forebears. Those meanings did, however, become attached to the building type by later viewers and the architects who created the Imperial fora. In order to appreciate this phenomenon, the author questions the usefulness of fixed categories like \"Hellenistic\" and \"Roman\" and argues for a history sensitive to the fluidic intentions and changing meanings of architecture.","container-title":"Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians","DOI":"10.1525/jsah.2011.70.4.421","ISSN":"00379808, 21505926","issue":"4","language":"en","page":"421-441","source":"CrossRef","title":"Adrift toward Empire: The Lost Porticus Octavia in Rome and the Origins of the Imperial Fora","title-short":"Adrift toward Empire","URL":"http://jsah.ucpress.edu/cgi/doi/10.1525/jsah.2011.70.4.421","volume":"70","author":[{"family":"Senseney","given":"John R."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12]]}},

In 1994, a Punic burial crypt was discovered on Byrsa Hill, near the entry to the National Museum of Carthage in Tunisia. Inside this crypt were the remains of a young man along with a range of burial goods, all dating to the late 6 th  century BCE. Here we describe the complete mitochondrial genome recovered from the Young Man of Byrsa and identify that he carried a rare European haplogroup, likely linking his maternal ancestry to Phoenician influenced locations somewhere on the North Mediterranean coast, the islands of the Mediterranean or the Iberian Peninsula. This result not only provides the first direct ancient DNA evidence of a Phoenician individual but the earliest evidence of a European mitochondrial haplogroup, U5b2c1, in North Africa.","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0155046","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","note":"e0155046","page":"16","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A European Mitochondrial Haplotype Identified in Ancient Phoenician Remains from Carthage, North Africa","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155046","volume":"11","author":[{"family":"Matisoo-Smith","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Gosling","given":"Anna L."},{"family":"Boocock","given":"James"},{"family":"Kardailsky","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Kurumilian","given":"Yara"},{"family":"Roudesli-Chebbi","given":"Sihem"},{"family":"Badre","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Morel","given":"Jean-Paul"},{"family":"Sebaï","given":"Leïla Ladjimi"},{"family":"Zalloua","given":"Pierre A."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,25]]},"container-title-short":"PLOS ONE"},

The paper investigates in the first place some brief references to divorce, the <i>hereditas sine sacris</i> and loans given by slaves, and then examines three main legal problems of the comedy, i.e., <i>mandatum</i>, <i>sponsio</i> and <i>dos</i>. The article argues for the legal character of the <i>mandatum</i> between Charmides and Callicles, as well as for the lack of legal validity of Lesbonicus&apos; and Lysiteles&apos; transactions and examines the way such legal actions are used by Plautus for intensifying the comic outcome.

The comparison between the two men involves an examination of two intellectual traditions which run through the history of the study of pottery. The first of these accentuates the documentary value of vases and the need to ensure their global publication, while the second views vases as objets d'art, and endeavours to trace the development of artistic forms by constructing a history of vase-painters. In reality these approaches are not directly conflicting, but represent two poles around which the discipline of pottery scholarship is organized. By showing how both interpretations have gained support in the more recent past, this work aims to provide a better understanding of the issues involved in the study of pottery today.\"--Jacket.","ISBN":"0-19-815272-8 978-0-19-815272-9","language":"Translated from the French.","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Approaches to the study of Attic vases: Beazley and Pottier","title-short":"Approaches to the study of Attic vases","author":[{"family":"Rouet","given":"Philippe"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"publisher-place":"Oxford; New York"},

Even though pie charts have been around for over 200 years, our understanding of the perceptual factors used to read data in them is still limited. Data is encoded in pie and donut charts in three ways: arc length, center angle, and segment area. For our first study, we designed variations of pie charts to test the importance of individual encodings for reading accuracy. In our second study, we varied the inner radius of a donut chart from a filled pie to a thin outline to test the impact of removing the central angle. Both studies point to angle being the least important visual cue for both charts, and the donut chart being as accurate as the traditional pie chart.","container-title":"Computer Graphics Forum (Proceedings EuroVis)","DOI":"10.1111/cgf.12888","issue":"3","page":"121-130","title":"Drew Skau, Robert Kosara, Arcs, Angles, or Areas: Individual Data Encodings in Pie and Donut Charts","volume":"35","author":[{"family":"Skau","given":"Drew"},{"family":"Kosara","given":"Robert"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]}},

  {"id":"Staveley1990","type":"chapter","abstract":"THE ROMAN COMMONWEALTH\nBy the year 280 B.C., when Pyrrhus of Epirus first set foot in Italy, Rome had already established control, direct or indirect, over a broad band of the Italian peninsula extending from coast to coast and lying along its length for a distance in excess of 240 km. (Maps 6–7). The ager Romanus alone, the territory which was in the dominium of the Roman state, had swollen eightfold in the space of just sixty years from a mere 2000 to approximately 16,000 km. (cf. also Fig. 47 (p. 382)). From the central zone which incorporated the original urban tribes and those established on Veientan territory it radiated in three distinct spurs. One of these, by far the longest, embraced virtually the entire coastal belt from the Tiber to the township of Cumae in the south-east corner of the Campanian plain. Much of it was occupied by citizens with full voting rights – the inhabitants of the enfranchised Latin states of Lanuvium, Aricia, and Lavinium, and Roman settlers who were incorporated into the six new tribes which had been formed both along the line of the Via Appia northwest of Tarracina and in the fertile lower reaches of the Liris and Volturnus rivers. With the exception of the old Latin settlements at Ardea and Circeii and the very small maritime colonies at Antium, Tarracina, Minturnae, and Sinuessa, the remainder of this strip, comprising principally Velitrae, Privernum, Fundi, Formiae, and the Campanian townships, was occupied by cives sine suffragio. A second spur of ager Romanus extended from Rome in a more easterly direction and was separated from the coastal strip for most of its length by a succession of Latin colonies and allied townships.","container-title":"The Cambridge ancient history.

  {"id":"Cornell1990","type":"chapter","abstract":"ROME'S FIRST STRUGGLE WITH THE SAMNITES, THE DEFEAT OF THE LATINS AND THE FORMATION OF THE ROMAN COMMONWEALTH\nThe emergence of the nobility and the competition for honours among its individual members, described in the previous chapter, were directly related to the development of Roman imperialism. The great political figures who dominated public life in the second half of the fourth century B.C. initiated and directed a policy of military conquest which in the space of little more than half a century brought all of peninsular Italy under Rome's control. This process was dominated by the struggle between Rome and the Samnites, which began in 343 B.C.\nThe Samnites were a powerful federation of tribes who occupied a large area of the southern central Appennines. Samnium was a land-locked region, roughly rectangular in shape, which stretched diagonally from the river Sagrus (Sangro) in the north-west to a point beyond the Aufidus (Ofanto) in the south-east. On its north-eastern side it was separated from the coast by the lands of the Frentani and Apuli, and on the south-western side by those of the Volsci, Sidicini, Aurunci, Campani and Alfaterni. The precise line of the frontier in 343 B.C. cannot be drawn with any certainty; its probable course is most easily indicated on a map (see Map 5).\nThe area defined by these conjectural limits measures some 12,500 km. Both in antiquity and in more recent times Samnium seems to have been densely populated by comparison with other rural areas of peninsular Italy. On the basis of modern calculations the total population of Samnium in 343 B.C. can be estimated at around 450,000 persons.","container-title":"The Cambridge ancient history.

The paper delineates the evolving scenario of the modern scholarly record and describes the functionality of future OCIs as well as the radical changes in scholarly practices including new reading, learning, and information-seeking practices enabled by OCIs.","container-title":"Publications","DOI":"10.3390/publications4020013","issue":"2","language":"en","page":"18","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Vision for Open Cyber-Scholarly Infrastructures","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/4/2/13","volume":"4","author":[{"family":"Thanos","given":"Costantino"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,9]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,24]]}},

  {"id":"Moore2008","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Although some scholars continue to debate the relative significance of race versus class, others have argued for an analysis that underscores the interlocking nature of these stratification systems. This research builds upon the intersectionality perspective to investigate the importance of culture in understanding racial and class stratification and identity. By describing a racialized class structure, this research challenges race scholars to rethink the meanings of socioeconomic class. It also identifies ways in which class shapes the articulation of a black racial identity. The article presents two competing forms of black middle-class identity (multi-class and middle-class minded) in the USA that highlight the intersections of race, class and culture. The data is based on a three-year community ethnography, including interviews with 35 residents. Results show the centrality of morality and a racial ideology of resistance as prominent resistance strategies of action with a black middle-class habitus. This article describes two competing forms of black middle-class identity and the tensions that emerge between them. It concludes with a discussion of the necessity for a more emic understanding of class stratification.","container-title":"Ethnicities","ISSN":"1468-7968","issue":"4","page":"492-517","source":"JSTOR","title":"Class formations: Competing forms of black middle-class identity","title-short":"Class formations","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23890179","volume":"8","author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Kesha S."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,4]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"container-title-short":"Ethnicities"},

  {"id":"Casadio2003","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is threefold. Starting from a new analysis of some selected sources but also from a reappraisal of the highlights of scholarly literature, it aims to reassess the category of the Mediterranean \"dying and rising gods,\" or \"deities subject to vicissitude.\" A first conclusion is that in spite of past and present criticism this category holds it own and is still valuable for the work of the historian of religions. Secondly it is argued that an evaluation of some significant details in the parallel stories of Attis, Adonis, Osiris (and, mutatis mutandis, those of Dionysus and Mithras) demonstrates that deep-seated human urges may determine the formation of recurring mythical motifs. In order to clarify the background of this process, some Freudian formulas (the castration complex, the fear of death vs. the fear of castration) may be put to the test and yield profitable results. Another, \"meta-critical\" implication of this discussion is that our ways of collecting data, making comparisons, and suggesting solutions may be deeply conditioned by personal concerns.","container-title":"Numen","ISSN":"0029-5973","issue":"3","page":"231-268","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Failing Male God: Emasculation, Death and Other Accidents in the Ancient Mediterranean World","title-short":"The Failing Male God","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3270488","volume":"50","author":[{"family":"Casadio","given":"Giovanni"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"container-title-short":"Numen"},

  {"id":"Ziolkowski1994","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Il Pantheon di Agrippa non era un reale pantheion, essendo questo appellativo unicamente legato a motivi storici. Non si traita di un santuario dinastico, perché uno dei suoi dei tutelari, Marte, non fu mai considerato un antenato divino degli Iulii. Un indizio per la sua interpretazione viene dalla sua collocazione topografica. Assieme alla basilica di Nettuno (un memoriale aile vittorie navali di Agrippa, in particolare Actium) esso formava un complesso di due edifici simili che si aprivano su una piazza posta fra di loro. Le divinità di Actium erano Apollo, divinità personale di Augusto, e due esperti militari divini, Marte e Nettuno. Il pantheon di Agrippa avrebbe dovuto quindi essere dedicato a Marte e commemorare le vittorie terrestri dei suo fondatore. Ciò è corroborato dai Fasti Fratrum Arvalium del 23 settembre, che citano feste dedicate a: Marti, Neptuno in Campo, Apollini e theatrum Marcelli. I tempii di Marte e Nettuno in Campo, fondati sotto Augusto nella zona delle attività costruttive di Agrippa e dedicati ad Augusto nel giorno del suo compleanno insieme al tempio di Apollo, erano sicuramente memoriali per Actium. Poichè la Basilica di Nettuno viene anche riferita come τò ποσεıώνıον, il che rende inevitabile la sua identificazione con il tempio di Nettuno in Campo, il Pantheon di Agrippa avrebbe dovuto essere il tempio di Marte in Campo. Questi tempii, costruiti su terreni privati ed assenti dal calendario uíficiale, costituivano sacra privata. Ciò facilitò la loro reinterpretazione, nel successivo periodo dei Giulio-Claudii, discendenti di Marco Antonio, rispettivamente di mal definito pantheion (non una aedes publica, poichè le iscrizioni conservate da Adriano non citano alcuna divinità) e di basilica.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","ISSN":"0068-2462","note":"00008","page":"261-277","source":"JSTOR","title":"Was Agrippa's Pantheon the Temple of Mars \"In Campo?\"","title-short":"Was Agrippa's Pantheon the Temple of Mars \"In Campo?","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40344506","volume":"62","author":[{"family":"Ziolkowski","given":"Adam"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,15]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},

  {"id":"Castagnoli1984","type":"article-journal","abstract":"1. An analysis of the meaning of the terms aedes, templum, delubrum,fanum, sacrarium, lucus: even if these terms are often interchangeable, the precise meaning of each can be established. 2. On the basis of the original meaning of templum (a ritually delimited space), it is proposed to apply this term to the platform with the aedes of Fortuna and of Mater Matuta, the 'area sacra di S. Omobono', and also to the 'podium' of the temple of the Capitoline triad. A typological comparison may also be made between these two templa, which were perhaps constructed at almost the same time. 3. The typology of the temple inside an area bounded by a portico may also be referred to the templum. The numerous variants of this typology are examined. 4. After a consideration of templum in its more specific sense of locus augurii aut auspicii causa definitus, the two auguracula—on the arx and the collis Latiaris—are examined in particular, and new identifications are proposed for them. 5. The term lucus raises the question of extra-urban cult sites. A scheme of classification is proposed: shrines of purely local importance, and sanctuaries repeating city cults in more distant sites (political motivation may be detected). For cult sites very close to the city the problem is more complex, involving in part the pomerium, evocatio, and the introduction of foreign cults.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","ISSN":"0068-2462","note":"00021","page":"3-20","source":"JSTOR","title":"Il Tempio Romano: Questioni di Terminologia e di Tipologia","title-short":"Il Tempio Romano","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40310802","volume":"52","author":[{"family":"Castagnoli","given":"Ferdinando"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1984]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},
  {"id":"Richardson1977","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The temple of Hercules Musarum in the southern part of the Campus Martius has been neglected, in part because no remains of it are visible today, in part because the cult is an anomaly. Yet it was an important building, originally founded as a victory monument by M. Fulvius Nobilior, the conqueror of Aetolia and friend of Ennius, and rebuilt with great splendor by L. Marcius Philippus, Augustus's step-father. It appears on the Severan Forma Urbis Romae with only small and unimportant lacunae, and the main problem must be interpretation of this plan in the light of the testimonia. Examination of the sources suggests Fulvius Nobilior's temple was to the Muses alone and may not have been architecturally significant; all that we really know is that it contained a set of statues of the nine Muses and a small bronze aedicula ascribed to the time of Numa. Philip's rebuilding, on the other hand, made it a major temple of surprising subtlety and complexity, with focus both forward and back. The cult of Hercules Musarum, which Philip probably grafted on to the old cult of the Muses, may have been the invention of Q. Pomponius Musa some forty years earlier.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.2307/503009","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"3","note":"00022","page":"355-361","source":"JSTOR","title":"Hercules Musarum and the Porticus Philippi in Rome","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/503009","volume":"81","author":[{"family":"Richardson","given":"L."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,15]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1977]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

  {"id":"2010-1","type":"webpage","abstract":"We describe a novel device that can be used as a 2.5D \"scanner\" for acquiring surface texture and shape. The device consists of a slab of clear elastomer covered with a reflective skin. When an object presses on the skin, the skin distorts to take on the shape of the object's surface. When viewed from behind (through the elastomer slab), the skin appears as a relief replica of the surface. A camera records an image of this relief, using illumination from red, green, and blue light sources at three different positions. A photometric stereo algorithm that is tailored to the device is then used to reconstruct the surface. There is no problem dealing with transparent or specular materials because the skin supplies its own BRDF. Complete information is recorded in a single frame; therefore we can record video of the changing deformation of the skin, and then generate an animation of the changing surface. Our sensor has no moving parts (other than the elastomer slab), uses inexpensive materials, and can be made into a portable device that can be used \"in the field\" to record surface shape and texture.","title":"Retrographic sensing for the measurement of surface texture and shape","URL":"http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/59425","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]}},

An explanation drawing on anthropological studies of witchcraft and the work of Giovannini, Girard, and Douglas allows a partial solution to this and three other puzzles: 1) their unique legal status; 2) their murder at moments of political crisis; 3) the odd details of those murders. The untouched body of the Vestal Virgin is a metonymy for the untouched city of Rome. Her unique legal status frees her from all family ties so that she can incarnate the collective. Thus, in times of crisis, she serves as a pharmakos/pharmakon. Equally, Roman society reveals a deep fear of witchcraft directed at its own matrons. Danger to the urbs is warded off by the punishment of women, both Vestals and wives, and the foundation of public cults of chastity with admonitory and apotropaic functions. A series of incidents over a thousand-year span reveals a world view deeply rooted in sympathetic magic, where the women embody the state and their inviolability is objectified as the inviolability of the community.","container-title":"The American Journal of Philology","ISSN":"00029475","issue":"4","note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Winter, 2004 / Copyright © 2004 The Johns Hopkins University Press","page":"563-601","title":"Why Were the Vestals Virgins?

  {"id":"Rockoff2009","type":"article-journal","abstract":"A vast majority of adults believe that class size reductions are a good way to improve the quality of public schools. Reviews of the research literature, on the other hand, have provided mixed messages on the degree to which class size matters for student achievement. Here I will discuss a substantial, but overlooked, body of experimental work on class size that developed prior to World War II. These field experiments did not have the benefit of modern econometrics, and only a few were done on a reasonably large scale. However, they often used careful empirical designs, and the collective magnitude of this body of work is considerable. Moreover, this research produced little evidence to suggest that students learn more in smaller classes, which stands in contrast to some, though not all, of the most recent work by economists. In this essay, I provide an overview of the scope and breadth of the field experiments in class size conducted prior to World War II, the motivations behind them, and how their experimental designs were crafted to deal with perceived sources of bias. I discuss how one might interpret the findings of these early experimental results alongside more recent research.","container-title":"Journal of Economic Perspectives","DOI":"10.1257/jep.23.4.211","ISSN":"0895-3309","issue":"4","page":"211-230","source":"CrossRef","title":"Field Experiments in Class Size from the Early Twentieth Century","URL":"http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/jep.23.4.211","volume":"23","author":[{"family":"Rockoff","given":"Jonah"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,11,25]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11]]}},

I use variation in class size driven by idiosyncratic variation in the population.

We find that teacher effects far outweigh class size effects, and that young teachers and first time teachers perform significantly worse than their peers. Furthermore, we study whether teacher effects are correlated with observables, and find no significant variables beyond being a full time teacher. Overall, these findings suggest that at the higher education level the optimal strategy is to have large classrooms with highly qualified teachers.","publisher":"Instituto de Economia.

This paper seeks to uncover what we may legitimately and appropriately say about Roman kingship, to investigate some of the major interpretative trends of the past century or so, and to propose a more complex model of the generation of traditions about an institution and a phenomenon which may in reality have been far more fluid and unstable than the Romans themselves portrayed it.","container-title":"Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies","DOI":"10.1111/j.2041-5370.2011.00022.x","ISSN":"00760730","issue":"2","page":"21-42","source":"CrossRef","title":"Thinking about Kings","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.2041-5370.2011.00022.x","volume":"54","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Christopher John"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,29]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12]]},"container-title-short":"BICS"},

  {"id":"Arata2004","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Substantial evidence supports the perspective that the people of Ancient Greece had a language for and some use for drugs, both for the purpose of medicine and poison; however, the question remains whether Ancient Greek civilization held a concept approximating what we today call drug addiction. This article explores the textual evidence for the use of two drugs, nepenthes and cannabis, in Ancient Greece. While the existence of nepenthes remains in doubt, the use of cannabis is well documented. Either drug or both drugs may have been used in the rites of the Bacchic and Orphic mysteries, which might explain why there are so few references to these drugs in the Ancient Greek literature.","container-title":"Janus","ISSN":"1521-9194","issue":"1","page":"34-49","title":"Nepenthes and Cannabis in Ancient Greece","URL":"http://www.janushead.org/7-1/Arata.pdf","volume":"7","author":[{"family":"Arata","given":"Luigi"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]],"season":2}},

  {"id":"Dobbins1994","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This article offers an archaeological and structural analysis of the four main buildings on the east side of the forum at Pompeii and challenges widely published and generally accepted views about the forum. Major problems of chronology, decoration, and urban design are emphasized through a methodology that rejects the prevalent building-by-building approach to the forum in favor of an approach that allows the significance of the urban ensemble to reveal itself. Connections with Rome in areas of building type, iconography, and design are stressed. A reexamination of the evidence points to a comprehensive post-earthquake (i.e., post-62) plan for the east side of the forum, a design whose hallmarks are the unification and monumentalization of the urban center. These goals were achieved by blocking streets, linking facades, upgrading building materials, and emphasizing the now more prominent northeastern and southeastern entrances. The concomitant economic implications are significant. Rather than being a symbol of the depressed economic conditions at Pompeii after 62, the forum with its vigorous and ambitious post-earthquake building program reveals both a desire to rebuild on a grand scale and an ability (with assistance from Rome?) to carry it out.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.2307/506550","ISSN":"00029114","issue":"4","note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Oct., 1994 / Copyright © 1994 Archaeological Institute of America","page":"629-694","title":"Problems of Chronology, Decoration, and Urban Design in the Forum at Pompeii","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/506550","volume":"98","author":[{"family":"Dobbins","given":"John J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1994,10,1]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

A comparative analysis of the historical development of boxing in Europe indicates that this Hallstatt period discipline in all probability did not differ greatly from similar martial sports known to the ancient Greeks, nor the later English bare knuckle boxing. The main difference was the use of dumbbells, which were evidently intended to weigh down the fists. In contrast to certain other researchers who have discussed this theme, it is considered that Hallstatt boxing represented a technically sophisticated martial art whose aim was to physically defeat or incapacitate the opponent, and not merely a skillful game of knocking the dumbbells out of the opponent’s hands.","container-title":"Arheološki Vestnik","page":"261-288","title":"The fighting techniques of the Hallstatt period boxers: an attempt at reinterpretation of the situla art","volume":"62","author":[{"family":"Lazar","given":"Tomaž"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]}},

This connectedness is found in many incarnations: in the rapid growth of the Internet, in the ease with which global communication takes place, and in the ability of news and information as well as epidemics and financial crises to spread with surprising speed and intensity. These are phenomena that involve networks, incentives, and the aggregate behavior of groups of people; they are based on the links that connect us and the ways in which our decisions can have subtle consequences for others. This introductory undergraduate textbook takes an interdisciplinary look at economics, sociology, computing and information science, and applied mathematics to understand networks and behavior. It describes the emerging field of study that is growing at the interface of these areas, addressing fundamental questions about how the social, economic, and technological worlds are connected\"--Provided by publisher.","ISBN":"978-0-511-77675-5 0-511-77675-6 0-521-19533-0 978-0-521-19533-1 978-0-511-76194-2 0-511-76194-5","language":"English","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Networks, crowds, and markets reasoning about a highly connected world","URL":"http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=324125","author":[{"family":"Easley","given":"David"},{"family":"Kleinberg","given":"Jon"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,29]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"publisher-place":"New York"},

  {"id":"Armstrong2013","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Family bonds, and particularly fraternal relationships, play key roles in many of the narratives relating to Rome’s Regal and early Republican periods. In particular, the literary sources for these periods are full of references to brothers standing side by side, fighting for, and in many ways embodying (sometimes quite literally), the various social and political entities which were struggling for supremacy in archaic Latium. The present study will endeavour to tease out some of the nuances of this bond and explain how the concept of brotherhood in early Roman narratives seems to differ from that presented in accounts relating to the late Republic. It will accomplish this using four case studies in early Roman brotherhood—Romulus and Remus, the Dioscuri, the Battle of the Champions, and the archaic sodales—which cover the diverse range of relationships encapsulated in the early Roman concept of fraternity, demonstrating how the current scholarly interpretation of Roman brotherhood, based largely on the principle of equality, does not fully describe the bond as it relates to this period. While equality, and to a certain extent blood, do seem to represent key aspects or preconditions of Roman fraternity, in accounts of the early city it was actually military camaraderie and battlefield unity which seem to have been the defining characteristics. This interpretation of early Roman fraternity shifts our understanding of the relationship toward a more active, and arguably ephemeral, model and sheds further light on myths involving brothers from early Rome and particularly those—like that of Romulus and Remus—which involve the breakdown of this bond.","container-title":"Journal of Ancient History","DOI":"10.1515/jah-2013-0004","ISSN":"2324-8114","issue":"1","page":"53-69","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"“Bands of Brothers”: Warfare and Fraternity in Early Rome","title-short":"“Bands of Brothers”","URL":"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jah-2013-1-issue-1/jah-2013-0004/jah-2013-0004.xml?format=INT","volume":"1","author":[{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Jeremy"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]}},

  {"id":"Hughey2013","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The first advanced Bronze Age civilization of Europe was established by the Minoans about 5,000 years before present. Since Sir Arthur Evans exposed the Minoan civic centre of Knossos, archaeologists have speculated on the origin of the founders of the civilization. Evans proposed a North African origin; Cycladic, Balkan, Anatolian and Middle Eastern origins have also been proposed. Here we address the question of the origin of the Minoans by analysing mitochondrial DNA from Minoan osseous remains from a cave ossuary in the Lassithi plateau of Crete dated 4,400–3,700 years before present. Shared haplotypes, principal component and pairwise distance analyses refute the Evans North African hypothesis. Minoans show the strongest relationships with Neolithic and modern European populations and with the modern inhabitants of the Lassithi plateau. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis of an autochthonous development of the Minoan civilization by the descendants of the Neolithic settlers of the island.","container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms2871","ISSN":"2041-1723","page":"1861","source":"CrossRef","title":"A European population in Minoan Bronze Age Crete","URL":"http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms2871","volume":"4","author":[{"family":"Hughey","given":"Jeffery R."},{"family":"Paschou","given":"Peristera"},{"family":"Drineas","given":"Petros"},{"family":"Mastropaolo","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Lotakis","given":"Dimitra M."},{"family":"Navas","given":"Patrick A."},{"family":"Michalodimitrakis","given":"Manolis"},{"family":"Stamatoyannopoulos","given":"John A."},{"family":"Stamatoyannopoulos","given":"George"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,19]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,14]]}},
  {"id":"Arnaiz-Villena2001","type":"article-journal","abstract":"HLA alleles have been determined in individuals from the Republic of Macedonia by DNA typing and sequencing. HLA-A, -B, -DR, -DQ allele frequencies and extended haplotypes have been for the first time determined and the results compared to those of other Mediterraneans, particularly with their neighbouring Greeks. Genetic distances, neighbor-joining dendrograms and correspondence analysis have been performed. The following conclusions have been reached: 1) Macedonians belong to the \"older\" Mediterranean substratum, like Iberians (including Basques), North Africans, Italians, French, Cretans, Jews, Lebanese, Turks (Anatolians), Armenians and Iranians, 2) Macedonians are not related with geographically close Greeks, who do not belong to the \"older\" Mediterranenan substratum, 3) Greeks are found to have a substantial relatedness to sub-Saharan (Ethiopian) people, which separate them from other Mediterranean groups. Both Greeks and Ethiopians share quasi-specific DRB1 alleles, such as *0305, *0307, *0411, *0413, *0416, *0417, *0420, *1110, *1112, *1304 and *1310. Genetic distances are closer between Greeks and Ethiopian/sub-Saharan groups than to any other Mediterranean group and finally Greeks cluster with Ethiopians/sub-Saharans in both neighbour joining dendrograms and correspondence analyses. The time period when these relationships might have occurred was ancient but uncertain and might be related to the displacement of Egyptian-Ethiopian people living in pharaonic Egypt.","container-title":"Tissue antigens","ISSN":"0001-2815","issue":"2","language":"eng","page":"118-127","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"HLA genes in Macedonians and the sub-Saharan origin of the Greeks","volume":"57","author":[{"family":"Arnaiz-Villena","given":"A"},{"family":"Dimitroski","given":"K"},{"family":"Pacho","given":"A"},{"family":"Moscoso","given":"J"},{"family":"Gómez-Casado","given":"E"},{"family":"Silvera-Redondo","given":"C"},{"family":"Varela","given":"P"},{"family":"Blagoevska","given":"M"},{"family":"Zdravkovska","given":"V"},{"family":"Martínez-Laso","given":"J"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,2]]},"PMID":"11260506"},

  {"id":"Gurley1991","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Proteins have been successfully extracted from the fossil vertebra of a 150-million-year-old sauropod dinosaur (\"Seismosaurus\") recently excavated from the Morrison Formation of New Mexico. HCl and guanidine.HCl extracts of the fossil bone and its sandstone matrix were concentrated, demineralized, and resolved into a number of different protein fractions by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). One of these fractions had the same retention time as collagen. Amino acid analysis (Pico-Tag method) of these fractions confirmed they were proteins. Comparison of the correlation coefficients of the amino acid analyses with that of collagen standards indicated that none of the fractions contained significant amounts of collagen. Similar HPLC profiles were obtained for the HCl extracts of fossil bone and its sandstone matrix suggesting they contained the same proteins. However, different HPLC profiles were obtained when these HCl extracts were dried and reextracted with guanidine.HCl. These different fractions represent proteins unique to the fossil and were not found in the sandstone matrix. These differences were confirmed by amino acid analysis. Such information on fossil bone proteins might provide useful knowledge concerning the evolution of skeletal molecules and the fossilization process. Similar information on the proteins from the geological matrix might provide useful fingerprints for reconstructing ancient environments and for assessing sedimentary rocks for fossil fuel exploration.","container-title":"Journal of protein chemistry","ISSN":"0277-8033","issue":"1","language":"eng","page":"75-90","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Proteins in the fossil bone of the dinosaur, Seismosaurus","volume":"10","author":[{"family":"Gurley","given":"L R"},{"family":"Valdez","given":"J G"},{"family":"Spall","given":"W D"},{"family":"Smith","given":"B F"},{"family":"Gillette","given":"D D"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1991,2]]},"PMID":"2054066","container-title-short":"J.

Its focus is on scientific research from peer-reviewed journal articles. Building capacities in Member States for Open Access is a necessary but not sufficient condition for promotion of the concept. Creating an enabling policy environment for OA is therefore a priority. This publication will serve the needs of OA policy development at the government, institutional and funding agency level. The overall objective of the Policy Guidelines is to promote Open Access in Member States by facilitating understanding of all relevant issues related to Open Access.  The guidelines are not prescriptive in nature, but are suggestive to facilitate knowledge-based decision-making to adopt OA policies and strengthen national research systems.","ISBN":"978-92-3-001052-2 92-3-001052-9","language":"English","publisher":"United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Policy guidelines for the development and promotion of open access","author":[{"family":"Swan","given":"Alma"},{"literal":"Unesco"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"publisher-place":"Paris"},

  {"id":"Holloway1994","type":"book","abstract":"The archaeology of early Rome has progressed rapidly and dramatically over the last century. The excavation of the shrine of Aeneas at Lavinium and the report of walls of the Romulean city discovered on the slopes of the Palatine Hill are two of the widely reported major developments of the last quarter century. Less well-known are the richly furnished tombs of the seventh century BC, once known solely from the tombs at Praeneste, and now documented by finds throughout Latium. The largest necropolis of the early Latian Iron Age, some 600 tombs, has been explored at Osteria dell'Osa. In Rome, patrician houses of the sixth century BC have been excavated beside the Sacra Via. New archaic inscriptions, notably that of Publius Valerius from Satricum, have been found, and the authenticity of the inscription once thought to be the earliest example of Latin writing (the graffito of the \"Praeneste Fibula\") has been challenged. . The Archaeology of Early Rome and Latinum fills the need for an English guide to these discoveries and the many controversies resulting from them. In preparation, the author interviewed most of the leading figures in current research on the early periods of Rome and has illustrated the book with over 130 photographs, maps and line drawings.","ISBN":"0-415-08065-7 978-0-415-08065-1 0-415-14360-8 978-0-415-14360-8","language":"English","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The archaeology of early Rome and Latium","author":[{"family":"Holloway","given":"R.

Despite sector-wide medians that show strong student demand, favorable operating performance, and strengthened balance sheets, there is wide divergence among individual colleges and universities. An appreciable share with weaker market positions that are highly reliant on student charges experienced deterioration of key metrics. By contrast, the diversified market leading universities, typically rated in the Aaa and Aa rating categories, experienced healthy growth of tuition and fees, a strong rebound in philanthropic support, and more robust operating performance. We expect that weakened household wealth, high unemployment, and more discerning student demand favoring both low-cost as well as high- reputation will continue to weaken prospects for revenue growth and pressure a majority of the private college and university sector. Effective governance and management practices will play an increasingly important role in weathering near-term financial challenges and maintaining credit stability.","language":"Eng","number":"134286","page":"40","publisher":"Moody's Investors Service","title":"Private College and University Medians Highlight Divergent Credit Trends, Supporting Moody’s Mixed Outlook for the Higher Education Sector: Moody’s Fiscal Year 2010 U.S. Not-for-Profit Private College and University Medians","author":[{"family":"Maloney","given":"Jenny L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,8]]}},

  {"id":"Keels2013","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This study examines the gender and racial or ethnic gaps in college grades and graduation of a 1999 freshman cohort of students attending 24 selective predominantly White institutions (PWIs) and the factors that account for observed gaps. The study is guided by the question of whether gender, race or ethnicity, and socioeconomic status combine to affect college outcomes or whether they interact so that outcomes are more positive or adverse for one group than another. Gender gaps were observed for Black and Latino students. For Black students, the gender gap in degree attainment widened once sociodemographic factors were considered. In contrast, the gender gap for Latino students narrowed and became insignificant when sociodemographics were controlled. Additional within-group interactions were also evident. For example, the 6-year college graduation rates were higher for Black females than for males whose mothers did not have college degrees, but no gender gap existed when the mother had a college degree. These results show that among this sample of academically motivated students, the significance of gender depends on race and socioeconomic status. This suggests that improving minority success, especially for Black men at PWIs, requires extending the analysis beyond prior academic preparation to creating more supportive college environments.","container-title":"American Journal of Orthopsychiatry","DOI":"10.1111/ajop.12033","ISSN":"1939-0025","issue":"2pt3","language":"en","page":"310-322","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Getting Them Enrolled Is Only Half the Battle: College Success as a Function of Race or Ethnicity, Gender, and Class","title-short":"Getting Them Enrolled Is Only Half the Battle","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajop.12033/abstract","volume":"83","author":[{"family":"Keels","given":"Micere"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]}},

  {"id":"Paabo1985","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Artificial mummification was practised in Egypt from approximately 2600 BC until the fourth century AD. Because of the dry Egyptian climate, however, there are also many natural mummies preserved from earlier as well as later times. To elucidate whether this unique source of ancient human remains can be used for molecular genetic analyses, 23 mummies were investigated for DNA content. One 2,400-yr-old mummy of a child was found to contain DNA that could be molecularly cloned in a plasmid vector. I report here that one such clone contains two members of the Alu family of human repetitive DNA sequences, as detected by DNA hybridizations and nucleotide sequencing. These analyses show that substantial pieces of mummy DNA (3.4 kilobases) can be cloned and that the DNA fragments seem to contain little or no modifications introduced postmortem.","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/314644a0","ISSN":"0028-0836","issue":"6012","language":"eng","page":"644-645","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Molecular cloning of Ancient Egyptian mummy DNA","volume":"314","author":[{"family":"Pääbo","given":"Svante"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1985,4,18],[24]]},"PMID":"3990798"},

  {"id":"Roth1975","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The purpose of this essay is threefold: (1) methodological, to clarify a basic distinction in Max Weber's work, and historical analysis in general, between socio-historical models and developmental or \"secular\" theories; (2) theoretical, to examine two neglected aspects of Weber's analysis of charisma, the community of ideological virtuosi (a model), and the charisma of reason as a revolutionary legitimation founded on natural rights (a developmental theory); (3) substantive, to apply model and theory to the counterculture in order to provide a novel theoretical framework for its further study. Socio-historical models are generalizations which emphasize the repetitive side of history; developmental theories describe and explain particular historical phenomena. The model of the charismatic community of ideological virtuosi comprises an emotional consociation with a distinct pattern of ideology, membership and want satisfaction. Historically, the charisma of reason and natural rights, which infused its principles into the French Revolution and later into ethical socialism, was destroyed by the advent of evolutionary and deterministic Marxism. The recent youth and student rebellions are viewed as the charismatic eruption of a new moral mood reviving the charisma of reason, and the contemporary peaceful communes and warlike groups are interpreted as the counterculture's charismatic core.","container-title":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.2307/2094342","issue":"2","page":"148-157","source":"JSTOR","title":"Socio-Historical Model and Developmental Theory: Charismatic Community, Charisma of Reason and the Counterculture","title-short":"Socio-Historical Model and Developmental Theory","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2094342","volume":"40","author":[{"family":"Roth","given":"Guenther"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,22]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1975,4,1]]},"container-title-short":"ASR"},

Reassessment of the hydria leads to a modified attribution and revised ideas about black-figure painters working in Athens during the late sixth century B.C. Style, novel compositions, and the syntactical practice of repeating figures across fields to create narrative connections and paradigmatic relationships reveal artistic innovation. Iconographic and inscriptional evidence confirms the use of hydrias in elite convivial events. The choice of black-figure to reflect Peisistratid fountain-house construction suggests a conservative elite sensibility at the time that the Kleisthenic reforms were beginning to take shape.","container-title":"Hesperia","DOI":"10.2307/4134887","ISSN":"0018098X","issue":"3","note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Jul. - Sep., 2004 / Copyright © 2004 The American School of Classical Studies at Athens","page":"427-463","title":"The Alkmene Hydrias and Vase Painting in Late-Sixth-Century Athens","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4134887","volume":"73","author":[{"family":"Steiner","given":"Ann"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,7,1]]},"container-title-short":"Hesp"},

It is true\nthat Livy in Books 21–45 employs a regular internal–external–internal pattern based on\nthe consuls’ movements between Rome and their provinces, with copious details on routine\nmatters in the opening and closing domestic sections. However, Livy manipulates\nthis framework freely for his own purposes, especially when incorporating Polybian material.\nMoreover, the pattern is characteristic only of his account of the Middle Republic:\nthe annual narratives of Books 1–10 do not conform to it, and Livy probably abandoned\nit when dealing with events from the Social War on. It seems likely that the annual narratives\nof most of Livy’s predecessors were varied and informal, like those of Livy Books 1–\n10, and this is corroborated by fragments of Claudius Quadrigarius and Sallust’s Histories.\nLivy probably derived his mid-republican pattern from Valerius Antias: it will have been\nan innovatory feature of his work, based on documentary research, especially in the archives\nof the senate. Assessment of Tacitus’ handling of his annual narratives should take\naccount of the wide range of models available to him within the annalistic tradition.","call-number":"0009","container-title":"Histos","page":"1-43","title":"Structuring Roman history: The Consular year and the Roman historical tradition","URL":"http://research.ncl.ac.uk/histos/documents/2011.01RichStructuringRomanHistory143.pdf","volume":"5","author":[{"family":"Rich","given":"John"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]}},

Intervisibility is investigated with viewshed analysis. A chronological evolution of the peak sanctuary landscape is proposed, explaining the location of the sanctuaries, in relation to each other and other site types.","container-title":"Archeologia e Calcolatori","page":"161-170","title":"The Minoan peak sanctuary landscape through a GIS approach","URL":"http://soi.cnr.it/archcalc/indice/PDF13/10Soetens.pdf","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Soetens","given":"S."},{"family":"Driessen","given":"J."},{"family":"Sarris","given":"S."},{"family":"Topouzi","given":"S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]}},

  {"id":"Fitzgerald2001","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The study addressed at-risk first and second grade students' reading growth as they were tutored by minimally trained college students. The college students were volunteer work-study students participating in the recent national America Reads initiative. In all, 144 children received some amount of tutoring. Thirty-nine tutors used a four-part instructional lesson with the children. For main analyses, 64 children who received the full complement of tutoring sessions were compared to 19 who received fewer sessions. The main conclusions were: (a) Comparisons using a within-program control group showed that, on average, children made statistically significant gains in instructional reading level that could be attributed to the tutoring. The average gain for children receiving the full term of tutoring was 1.19 grade levels during six months of tutoring. (b) The greatest impact of tutoring was in affecting children's ability to read words. Among the children who received the full term of tutoring, most of their instructional reading level growth occurred during the second half of the program. (c) Patterns of growth in instructional reading level were different for low- and high-gains groups of children. /// [Spanish] Este estudio se ocupó del progreso en lectura de estudiantes en riesgo de primero y segundo grado que tenían como tutores a estudiantes universitarios mínimamente entrenados. Los estudiantes universitarios eran trabajadores voluntarios que participaban de la reciente iniciativa nacional América Lee (America Reads). En total, 144 niños recibieron cierta asistencia. Treinta y nueve tutores usaron con los niños un tipo de lección de intervención didáctica consistente en cuatro partes. Para los análisis principales, 64 niños que recibieron las sesiones completas de tutoría fueron comparados con 19 que recibieron menos sesiones. Las principales conclusiones fueron: (a) Las comparaciones usando un grupo de control intraprograma mostraron que, en promedio, los niños hicieron progresos estadísticamente significativos en el nivel de lectura que podrían atribuirse a la tutoría. El progreso promedio de los niños que recibieron la tutoría completa fue de 1.19 niveles de grado durante seis meses de tutoría. (b) El mayor impacto de las tutorías se produjo en la habilidad de los niños para leer palabras. Entre los niños que recibieron la tutoría completa, la mayor parte del progreso en lectura ocurrió durante la segunda mitad del programa. (c) Los patrones de crecimiento en nivel de lectura fueron diferentes para los grupos de niños de bajo y alto progreso. /// [German] Die Studie adressiert Lesesteigerungen von risikobetroffenen Schülern der ersten und zweiten Klasse, während sie von minimal vorbereiteten College-Studenten Nachhilfeunterricht erhielten. Die College-Studenten bestanden aus im Praktikum-Studium befindliche freiwillig mitarbeitende Studenten, die an der jüngsten amerikanischen nationalen Leseinitiative Amerika Reads teilnahmen. Insgesamt erhielten 144 Kinder eine gewisse Menge an Nachhilfe. Neununddreißig Tutoren nutzten einen aus vier Teilabschnitten bestehenden Unterricht mit den Kindern. Für die Hauptanalysen wurden vierundsechzig Kinder, die den vollen Verlauf an unterstützendem Nachhilfeunterricht vermittelt erhielten, mit 19 anderen verglichen, die weniger Unterricht erhielten. Die Hauptschlußfolgerungen ergaben: (a) Vergleiche unter Anwendung eines Internprogramms mit einer Kontrollgruppe zeigten, daß die Kinder im allgemeinen statistisch bedeutende Fortschritte in der Leseanweisungsstufe machten, welches dem Nachhilfeunterricht zugeschrieben werden könnte. Der durchschnittliche Zuwachs bei Kindern, die über den vollen Zeitraum Nachhilfe erhielten, war1.19 Zensurengrade im Laufe von sechs Monaten Nachhilfeunterricht. (b) Die größte Wirkung der Nachhilfe bestand in der Beeinflussung der Kinder in ihrer Fähigkeit, Worte zu lesen. Unter jenen Kindern, die über den vollen Zeitraum Nachhilfe erhielten, fand der größte Zuwachs aus der Leseanweisungsstufe während der zweiten Hälfte des Programmes statt. (c) Die Zuwachsmuster in den Leseanweisungsstufen waren bei Kindern in Schwach- und Hochleistungsgruppen unterschiedlich. /// [French] L'étude porte sur les progrès en lecture d'élèves de première et seconde année lors d'un tutorat d'éudiants de collège universitaire ayant reçu une formation minimale. Les étudiants étaient des étudiants qui s'étaient portés volontaires pour un travail pratique dans le cadre de la récente initiative «L'Amérique lit». Cent quarante quatre enfants au total ont reçu une certaine quantité de tutorat. Trente neuf tuteurs ont conduit une leçon en quatre parties avec les enfants. Les analyses principales comparent 64 enfants ayant suivi la totalité des sessions de tutorat et 19 enfants ayant suivi moins de sessions. Les conclusions principales sont: a) Les comparaisons utilisant un programme inteme de groupe contrôle montrent que, en moyenne, les enfants ont fait des progrès statistiquement significatifs en lecture que l'on peut attribuer au tutorat. Les enfants ayant suivi le programme complet de tutorat ont progressé de 1,9 années après six mois de tutorat. b) Le tutorat a eu un impact maximum sur la capacité des enfants à lire des mots. Parmi les enfants ayant suivi tout le programme de tutorat, la majeure partie des progrès ont eu lieu au cours de la seconde moitié du programme. c) Le type de progression du niveau de lecture n'est pas le même selon que les enfants ont beaucoup ou peu progressé. /// [Cyrillic] Исс[unknown]едова[unknown]ись успехи учеников первого и второго к[unknown]ассов, принад[unknown]ежащих к группе риска, которые учи[unknown]ись читать под руководством минима[unknown]ьно обученных студентов ко[unknown][unknown]еджа.

  {"id":"Hayden1990","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The central thesis of this article is that Mesolithic/Archaic technological innovations enabled some hunter/gatherers to create an abundant and stable resource base which could not be adversely affected by socioeconomic competition using food resources. In contrast to earlier hunter/gatherers, highly competitive individuals with accumulative personalities emerged in the new resource-rich communities, and they used the competitive feast as a means of developing, extending, and consolidating their power. It is in the context of these “accumulators” and the feasting complex that the first domesticates generally appear and diffuse most readily. This view stands in contrast to many models that posit domestication occurring in marginal hunting/gathering groups experiencing severe resource stress. The view of the first domesticates as prestige items used by accumulators to outclass their rivals explains the otherwise mystifying nature of many of the first domesticates, including dogs, gourds, chili peppers, and avocados.","container-title":"Journal of Anthropological Archaeology","DOI":"10.1016/0278-4165(90)90005-X","ISSN":"0278-4165","issue":"1","page":"31-69","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Nimrods, piscators, pluckers, and planters: The emergence of food production","title-short":"Nimrods, piscators, pluckers, and planters","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027841659090005X","volume":"9","author":[{"family":"Hayden","given":"Brian"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,9]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1990,3]]}},

  {"id":"Hillman1990","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Man's (or, more probably, Woman's) first cereal crops were sown from seed gathered from wild stands, and it was in the course of cultivation that domestication occurred. Experiments in the measurement of domestication rates indicate that in wild-type crops of einkorn, emmer, and barley under primitive systems of husbandry: (a) domestication will occur only if they are harvested when partially or nearly ripe, using specific harvesting methods; (b) exposure to shifting cultivation may sometimes have been required; and (c) under these conditions, the crops could become completely domesticated within 200 years, and perhaps only 20–30 years, without any conscious selection. This paper (a) considers possible delays in the start of domestication due to early crops of wild-type cereals lacking domestic-types mutants; (b) examines the husbandry practices necessary for these mutants to enjoy any selective advantage; (c) considers the state of ripeness at harvest necessary for the crops to respond to these selective pressures; (d) outlines field measurements of the selective intensities arising from analogous husbandry practices applied experimentally to living wild-type crops; (e) summarizes a mathematical model which incorporates the measured selective intensities and other key variables and which describes the rate of increase in domestic-type mutants in early populations of wild-type cereals under specific combinations of primitive husbandry practices; (f) considers why very early cultivators should have used those husbandry methods which, we suggest, led unconsciously to the domestication of wild wheats and barley; and (g) considers whether these events are likely to leave archaeologically recognizable traces.","container-title":"Journal of World Prehistory","ISSN":"0892-7537","issue":"2","page":"157-222","source":"JSTOR","title":"Measured Domestication Rates in Wild Wheats and Barley Under Primitive Cultivation, and Their Archaeological Implications","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25800578","volume":"4","author":[{"family":"Hillman","given":"Gordon C."},{"family":"Davies","given":"M.

We use a survey of almost 20,000 first-year students at 45 four-year institutions combined with institutional-level data to understand how aspects of first-year seminars affect early intentions to persist.

The characteristics of the responding institutions and the procedures and standards they use when evaluating tenure applications were analyzed to determine how they related to the protection of the incompetent. The results reveal that tenure is most likely to shield incompetent faculty when collegiality plays a role in tenure decisions and when departments focus on the quantity of articles an applicant publishes. The findings also show that when departments demand that candidates publish in prestigious journals and when higher authorities at the institution have reversed positive departmental tenure recommendations, the probability that the incompetent are protected declines.","container-title":"PS: Political Science & Politics","DOI":"10.1017/S1049096513001558","issue":"01","page":"182-187","source":"Cambridge Journals Online","title":"When Tenure Protects the Incompetent: Results from a Survey of Department Chairs","title-short":"When Tenure Protects the Incompetent","volume":"47","author":[{"family":"Rothgeb","given":"John M.

In this paper there is a discussion of previous analytical work and the use to which the analytical data may be put.\n\nFor published compositional analyses to be of use it is essential that details of the sampling, analytical procedure and standard deviation of the results be reported. The reasons for this are discussed in detail with examples from literature where failure to do this has made the interpretation of the reported analytical results difficult if not impossible.\n\nIn this part of the work the composition of about 300 Bronze Age and Geometric Greek bronzes are reported.

  {"id":"Craddock1978","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This is the third of a series of papers dealing with the composition of copper alloys used in the classical world.\n\nAlthough a few isolated examples of prehistoric copper alloys containing several per cent of zinc are known, notably from Cyprus, it was not until the first millennium BC that the deliberate production of brass commenced, probably in Asia Minor. From the 7th century the Greeks commented upon brass, but always as an expensive, exotic metal not produced in Greece, and this is borne out by the absence of zinc in the great majority of Greek bronzes. Similarly, of the many Etruscan bronzes analysed, only two from the 5th and 3rd centuries BC respectively were of brass and these contained about 11% zinc with less than 3% tin (see below).\n\nBy the 1st century BC the Romans were using the cementation process for producing brass. Initially it seems to have been used for coinage, but rapidly became popular in other fields, especially decorative metalwork where it largely replaced bronze. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD the zinc content of the coinage fell, and brasses with a high zinc content ceased to be used, although brass continued to be as popular as ever accounting for about 30% of Roman copper alloys. By the 3rd century an alloy of copper with a few per cent each of lead, zinc and tin (modern “leaded gunmetal”) was in regular use, and has remained so ever since.\n\nFrom the time of the King James Bible of 1611 in which all copper alloys are called “brass” irrespective of composition, the early development and use of brass has been confused, and learned books, both ancient and modern have often tended to increase rather than decrease this confusion! The origins of both terms “Brass” and bronze are obscure, but it seems that in medieval times brass was applied to all copper alloys, and only from the Renaissance the term bronzo was used in Italy to denote copper alloys specifically alloyed with tin. However the terms continued indiscriminately in use in England until the 19th century; Johnson defines bronze as brass in his Dictionary. However amongst the many works on the subject, those by Caley (1964) and Werner (1972) are very useful and shed much light on what is otherwise a rather dark area.\n\nBy combining the information in these books with the new analyses, particularly those of the Roman period to be published in subsequent parts of this work, a much more complete picture of the early history of brass from its inception until the end of the Roman Empire can be built up.\n\nFor the purposes of this review brass is taken to mean an alloy of copper to which zinc has been deliberately introduced. In pre-Roman brasses the zinc normally replaces tin, but in Roman brass the two metals are often both present in the alloy.","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/0305-4403(78)90015-8","ISSN":"0305-4403","issue":"1","page":"1-16","title":"The composition of the copper alloys used by the Greek, Etruscan and Roman civilizations: 3.

From the first examples of written Latin through Gregory of Tours in the sixth century and the Venerable Bede in the seventh, Latin Literature offers a wide-ranging panorama of all major Latin authors. Including names, dates, edition citations, and detailed summaries, the work combines the virtues of an encyclopedia with the critical intelligence readers have come to expect from Italy's leading Latinist, Gian Biagio Conte. Many of the entries - those on Virgil and Petronius, for example - provide elegantly compact formulations of work on the very frontier of current study, and virtually all entries offer something of interest for the lay reader and expert alike.","ISBN":"0-8018-4638-2 978-0-8018-4638-0","language":"Translated from Italian.","publisher":"Johns Hopkins University Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Latin literature: a history","title-short":"Latin literature","author":[{"family":"Conte","given":"Gian Biagio"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"publisher-place":"Baltimore"},
  {"id":"Cornell1975","type":"article-journal","abstract":"It is often observed that the familiar story of the origins of Rome appears to combine two distinct and incompatible legends: that of Aeneas, and that of Romulus and Remus. The first of these was in origin a development of a Greek story, with its roots in the epic tradition. Aeneas, the son of Venus and Anchises, escaped from Troy with his family and friends and after a series of adventures arrived in Italy where he founded Rome. The other story, that of Romulus and Remus, was localised in Latium. Romulus and Remus were the twin sons of the god Mars and Rea Silvia, daughter of a king of Alba Longa. On the orders of their grandfather they were cast into the Tiber. The river happened to be in flood, and when the waters receded the boat containing the infants was left high and dry at the foot of the Palatine, under a fig tree later known as the ficus Ruminalis. There they were suckled by a she-wolf, whose den was the near-by cave of the Lupercal. Rescued by shepherds, the boys grew up and after the death of Remus in suspicious circumstances Romulus founded a city on the Palatine, where his original dwelling, the casa Romuli, was preserved in later times.","container-title":"Proceedings of the Cambridge Philological Society","DOI":"10.1017/S0068673500003667","ISSN":"0068-6735","page":"1-32","source":"CrossRef","title":"Aeneas and the twins: the development of the Roman foundation legend","title-short":"Aeneas and the twins","URL":"http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0068673500003667","volume":"21","author":[{"family":"Cornell","given":"Tim J."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1975]]}},

  {"id":"Wet1975","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Weeds evolved, and are still evolving, within the man-made habitat in three principal ways: from colonizers through selection towards adaptation to continuous habitat disturbance; as derivatives of hybridization between wild and cultivated races of domestic species; and through selection towards re-establishing natural seed dispersal mechanisms in abandoned domesticates. Domesticates differ from weeds primarily in degree of dependency on man for survival. They evolved from wild food plants which were brought into cultivation. The process of domestication was initiated when man started to propagate plants in successive generations by means of seed or vegetative propagules. Phenotypic changes associated with planting and harvesting are species specific, and are brought about by natural selection under conditions of cultivation. Artificial selection by man during the domestication process is primarily responsible for subspecific variation in domestic species.","container-title":"Economic Botany","ISSN":"0013-0001","issue":"2","page":"99-107","source":"JSTOR","title":"Weeds and Domesticates: Evolution in the Man-Made Habitat","title-short":"Weeds and Domesticates","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4253576","volume":"29","author":[{"family":"Wet","given":"J.

  {"id":"Giuseppe2005","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Questo articolo propone una comparazione dell'Etruria settentrionale e meridionale dal punto di vista del 'comportamento' della ceramica a vernice nera, il principale fossile guida dell'età repubblicana e tra i principali indicatori della conquista romana e dell'integrazione dei popoli dell'Italia antica. La base documentaria da cui parte lo studio è costituita dalla ceramica a vernice nera proveniente dallo scavo del teatro romano di Volterra, sito in località di Vallebuona, e dalla South Etruria Survey condotta tra gli anni Cinquanta e Settanta da John Ward-Perkins e la sua équipe. La confrontabilità dei due contesti risiede nel fatto che, pur essendo essi stati indagati con tipi di ricerca differenti — uno scavo e una ricognizione — hanno entrambi restituito materiale residuo rappresentato da un numero di frammenti (ca. 11.000, precisamente 3.972 da Volterra e 6.985 dalla South Etruria Survey) sufficientemente significativo dal punto di vista statistico e cronologico, coprendo l'intero arco di produzione e ďuso della classe (IV-I secolo a.C.). L'articolo è strutturato in diverse sezioni: una premessa in cui vengono esplicitate le finalità del lavoro, una discussione sui diversi approcci allo studio della ceramica a vernice nera, l'analisi del caso di Volterra, l'analisi del caso dell'Etruria meridionale e la comparazione finale delle due aree. Lo strumento principale di analisi è costituito da un approccio quantitativo che include la cronologia, le produzioni e le forme in uso nelle due aree. Attraverso i momenti di crescita e crollo della ceramica si cercherà di comprendere non solo la storia della sua produzione, ma anche di leggere i più ampi fenomeni storici alla base dei risultati diversi ottenuti nei due comprensori dell'Etruria.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","ISSN":"0068-2462","page":"31-84","source":"JSTOR","title":"Un confronto tra l'etruria settentrionale e meridionale dal punto di vista della Ceramica a vernice nera","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40311091","volume":"73","author":[{"family":"Giuseppe","given":"Helga","dropping-particle":"di"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,20]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,1,1]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},

  {"id":"Evans1994","type":"book","abstract":"Any modern urban dweller in a hot, dry climate allows the value of the water supply; the Romans were no exception. Over a span of several centuries Rome supplied itself with a system of aqueducts that watered many neighborhoods and allowed the city to grow and expand. Water Distribution in Ancient Rome examines the nature and effects of this system and considers numerous important and interesting questions: How did water travel to the many neighborhoods of hilly Rome? Which neighborhoods were connected to the water system and how? What effects did the presence or absence of water have on the character of a given locale? Water Distribution in Ancient Rome draws on the difficult but critical work of the Roman engineer Frontinus. A consideration of Frontinus' writing, provided here in translation, reveals comprehensive planning by city officials over long periods of time and the difficulties these engineering feats posed. This engagingly written volume includes studies of the individual aqueducts and the neighborhoods they served. Water Distribution in Ancient Rome will be essential reading for students and scholars of Frontinus, of Roman engineering and the history of Rome, and of topography and archaeology.","ISBN":"0-472-10464-0 978-0-472-10464-2","language":"English","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Water distribution in ancient Rome: the evidence of Frontinus","title-short":"Water distribution in ancient Rome","author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"Harry B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"publisher-place":"Ann Arbor"},

A significant proportion of the vases with depictions of tragedy has been first published only in the last twenty-five years. There has been no sustained attempt to discuss these exciting additions in relation to tragedy, nor to reconsider the cultural context in the light of these discoveries.\" \"Oliver Taplin here sets out to examine the previously understudied tragic scenes. Through detailed scrutiny of some 109 vases and vase fragments with depictions of Greek tragedies, he is able to identify plays and scenes by the great playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Some scenes can with great certainty be identified with surviving tragedies, while the author more tentatively suggests that others may depict scenes from tragedies that are now lost or survive only as fragments.\"--BOOK JACKET.","ISBN":"978-0-89236-807-5 0-89236-807-1","language":"English","publisher":"J.

This was the period that saw the evolution of archaeology as a professional discipline as well as the rapid growth of the new photographic medium. With illustrations drawn from the collections of the Getty Museum and the Getty Research Institute, the essays in this book examine the growth of archaeology as a scientific discipline and its increasing reliance on photographic documentation, and they consider some of the conventions that came to govern the ostensibly objective photographs of antiquities and ancient sites. Biographical essays explore the careers of two major early photographers, Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey and William James Stillman. in addition, portfolios with works by Maxime Du Camp, John Beasley Greene, Francis Frith, Robert Macpherson, Adolphe Braun and others testify to the strength and consistency of other early photographers who captured the antique worlds around the Mediterranean.\"--BOOK JACKET.","ISBN":"0-89236-805-5 978-0-89236-805-1","language":"English","publisher":"The J.

  {"id":"Black2014","type":"report","abstract":"In recent years, many states, including California, Texas, and Oregon, have changed admissions policies to increase access to public universities for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.  A key concern, however, is how these students will perform.  This paper examines the relationship between high school quality and student success at college. Using newly available administrative data from the University of Texas at Austin, we take advantage of the unique policy environment provided by Texas’s Top Ten Percent automatic admissions law, which has not only increased the diversity of high schools in the state that send students to the university, but also provides an admission criteria based on a sole observable characteristic: high school class rank.  We find that high school characteristics do affect student performance, and these effects seem more pronounced for women and low-income students.  In addition, there is little evidence that the effects of high school characteristics decay over time.","collection-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","number":"19842","title":"Can You Leave High School Behind?","URL":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w19842","author":[{"family":"Black","given":"Sandra E."},{"family":"Lincove","given":"Jane Arnold"},{"family":"Cullinane","given":"Jenna"},{"family":"Veron","given":"Rachel"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]}},

  {"id":"Galinsky1996","type":"book","abstract":"Grand political accomplishment and artistic productivity were the hallmarks of Augustus Caesar's reign (31 B.C. to A.D. 14), which has served as a powerful model of achievement for societies throughout Western history. Although much research has been done on individual facets of Augustan culture, Karl Galinsky's book is the first in decades to present a unified overview, one that brings together political and social history, art, literature, architecture, and religion. Weaving analysis and narrative throughout a richly illustrated text, Galinsky provides not only an enjoyable account of the major ideas of the age, but also an interpretation of the creative tensions and contradictions that made for its vitality and influence. Galinsky draws on source material ranging from coins and inscriptions to the major works of poetry and art, and challenges the schematic concepts and dichotomies that have commonly been applied to Augustan culture. He demonstrates that this culture was neither monolithic nor the mere result of one man's will. Instead it was a nuanced process of evolution and experimentation. Augustan culture had many contributors, as Galinsky demonstrates, and their dynamic interactions resulted in a high point of creativity and complexity that explains the transcendence of the Augustan age. Far from being static, its sophisticated literary and artistic monuments call for the active response and involvement of the reader and viewer even today.","ISBN":"0-691-04435-X 978-0-691-04435-4","language":"English","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Augustan culture: an interpretive introduction","title-short":"Augustan culture","author":[{"family":"Galinsky","given":"Karl"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1996]]},"publisher-place":"Princeton, N.J."},

The manuscript tradition, however, reveals a special (possibly first) edition of the \"Hilarion\" explicitly dedicated to the ascetic Roman woman Asella. The present study reviews the nature of the pertinent manuscript evidence, identifies the discovery of the dedication in the early seventeenth century, and then discusses the dedication's loss from scholarly sight (and why it was lost), until its rediscovery by a graduate student at the University of Illinois in the 1930s. Finally, the literary and social contexts prompting Jerome's dedication of this particular vita to Asella are discussed.","container-title":"Vigiliae Christianae","ISSN":"0042-6032","issue":"3","page":"286-297","source":"JSTOR","title":"Jerome Dedicates His \"Vita Hilarionis\"","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1584573","volume":"59","author":[{"family":"Harvey Jr.","given":"Paul B."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,8,1]]}},

We find significant reductions in net prices relative to sticker prices and incomes across all income quintiles, as expected given financial aid policy changes at these schools in recent years. More interestingly, we find some increase in the share of low-income students at these schools, an increase on average from about 10% to 11% from the bottom 40% of the income distribution. We also find an increase in the share of the student body from the top income quintile receiving financial aid (from about 14.5% to 18% of the student body). The share of all students, aided and non-aided, from the top 20% of the income distribution has remained approximately constant during this period, suggesting that the increase in the share of aided students in this quintile has come from formerly unaided high income students.","genre":"Williams Project on the Economics of Higher Education","number":"DP-73","publisher":"Department of Economics, Williams College","source":"RePEc - IDEAS","title":"Affordability of Highly Selective Colleges and Universities II","URL":"http://ideas.repec.org/p/wil/wilehe/73.html","author":[{"family":"Winston","given":"Gordon C."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Catharine B."},{"family":"Atta","given":"David Davis-Van"},{"family":"Gambhir","given":"Rishad"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]}},

  {"id":"Keyser1988","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The standard theory of the origin of Latin numerals, found in all the best handbooks, is that of Mommsen (1850). He explains I, V, and X on a pictographic principle, and L, C, and ↀ = 1000 as forms of Greek letters (aspirates) unused in Latin. There are four other important theories: a long-rejected one proposed by the fifth-century A. C. grammarian Priscian, a tally-mark theory (dating back to 1546), various pictographic theories (dating back to 1655), and various acrophonic theories. The tally-mark theory, though held by numerous scholars through the end of the 19th century, has received little attention in the last 75 years. Mommsen's mixed theory and the other four important theories are critically reviewed. Available numismatic and epigraphical evidence, certain logical principles, and historical considerations are adduced to support the rejection of Mommsen's theory and the acceptance of a theory which holds that the Latin numerals are Etruscan tally-mark numerals which have undergone some alteration and abbreviation of their forms.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.2307/505248","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"4","page":"529-546","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Origin of the Latin Numerals 1 to 1000","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/505248","volume":"92","author":[{"family":"Keyser","given":"Paul"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,15]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1988,10,1]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

  {"id":"Schoeninger1981","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The reason that people accepted the responsibility of agriculture is still a subject of controversy. Most explanations include the inherent assumption that a change occurred in the subsistence base. This study investigated the dietary changes that accompanied the development of agriculture in the Middle East. Human and faunal bone samples were taken from three Epipaleolithic period levels at Kebara and el-Wad in the Levant and two Neolithic period sites (Ganj Dareh and Hajji Firuz) in Iran. The proportion of meat to vegetable materials in the diet was estimated by means of trace element analysis for strontium levels in bone. The trace element results from the Levantine sites indicate that human diet changed to include more plant products long before the development of agriculture. The results from the two Iranian sites indicate that the human diet contained relatively high amounts of meat in addition to cultivated plants. Considered together, the results suggest that agriculture did not provide a new food source, but rather, was an economic change which enabled human populations to continue, with increased control and reliability, subsistence systems that had been developed previously. Les raisons qui ont entrainé l'apparition de l'agriculture sont encore controversées, la plupart des explications font appel à un changement dans le mode principal de subsistance. Cette étude s'est attachée à rechercher les changements du régime alimentaire qui ont accompagné le développement de l'agriculture au Proche-Orient. Des échantillons d'ossements humains et animaux ont été prélevés dans trois couches de niveaux épipaléolithiques à Kébara et à el-Wad au Levant et dans deux sites néolithiques en Iran (Ganj Dareh et Hajji Firouz). Le rapport viande/végétaux dans l'alimentation a été estimé grâce au dosage de la quantité de strontium dans les os. Les résultats pour les sites du Levant suggèrent que l'alimentation a changé pour inclure davantage de produits végétaux bien avant le développement de l'agriculture. En ce qui concerne les deux sites iraniens, le régime alimentaire contenait une relativement grande proportion de viande, en plus des plantes cultivées. Si l'on considère l'ensemble des résultats, on peut suggérer que l'agriculture n'a pas fourni des sources nouvelles de nourriture, mais a entraîné un changement d'économie permettant aux populations humaines de continuer à suivre, avec des possibilités de contrôle et de régularité accrues, les systèmes de subsistance adoptés auparavant.","container-title":"Paléorient","issue":"1","page":"73-91","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Agricultural 'Revolution': Its effect on human diet in prehistoric Iran and Israel","title-short":"THE AGRICULTURAL « REVOLUTION »","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41489502","volume":"7","author":[{"family":"Schoeninger","given":"Margaret J."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1981,1,1]]}},

  {"id":"Laurence1984","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Congenital hydrocephalus is a relatively uncommon abnormality in population malformation surveys accounting for between four and ten out of every 10,000 births. In 30%, it is caused by aqueduct stenosis. The majority of cases have a multifactorial aetiology, the genetic component, which is polygenic, rendering the developing foetus susceptible to largely unidentified environmental factors in early development. Some cases are caused by single gene defects. Family studies suggest that the risk to siblings of a child with uncomplicated congenital hydrocephalus, where the anatomical site is not specified, is about 1 in 50 (1 in 40 for males, 1 in 80 for females). With aqueduct stenosis, the risk to brothers of affected boys is 1 in 22, to sisters only 1 in 50. The risks to siblings of sisters is less. Probably less than 2% of uncomplicated hydrocephalus has an X-linked basis and such an aetiology should be suspected if the special clinical features are present, there is more than one male sibling affected, or there are affected male relatives on the mother's side. Dandy-Walker's syndrome may be recessively inherited and there are some other, but very rare, monogenic causes for hydrocephalus. There is not obvious additional risk for neural tube defect. Non-directive genetic counselling should be given either at the genetic clinic or at a specially arranged clinic appointment and should include not only the risk to the family members, but also the options for avoiding recurrences, and any prenatal diagnostic tests available, such as high precision ultrasonography and a serum alphafetoprotein estimation at about sixteen weeks gestation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","container-title":"Zeitschrift für Kinderchirurgie: organ der Deutschen, der Schweizerischen und der Osterreichischen Gesellschaft für Kinderchirurgie = Surgery in infancy and childhood","DOI":"10.1055/s-2008-1044294","ISSN":"0174-3082","language":"eng","page":"96-99","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Genetic aspects of \"uncomplicated\" hydrocephalus and its relationship to neural tube defect","volume":"39 Suppl 2","author":[{"family":"Laurence","given":"K.

  {"id":"Pryor1986","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Using the standard cross-cultural sample, I show that the presence of agriculture in precapitalist societies is only weakly related to the richness of the environment and climate, but is more highly related to the population density. However, the density argument, which is based on the presence of diminishing returns in gathering and hunting, allows many exceptions. A series of other explanations for engaging in agriculture, particularly related to the reduction of risk occurring in the overreliance on other food production modes, are explored. Such an approach forces us to address a somewhat different question: Why haven't all societies adopted agriculture, at least to supply a small portion of their nourishment? Several societies are examined which, by any conventional theory including those proposed in this article, should be engaged in at least some agriculture; but they are not. If this puzzle of the obsence of agriculture is solved, we will be considerably further in understanding the nature of the transition to agriculture.","container-title":"American Anthropologist","issue":"4","page":"879-897","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Adoption of Agriculture: Some Theoretical and Empirical Evidence","title-short":"The Adoption of Agriculture","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/679077","volume":"88","author":[{"family":"Pryor","given":"Frederic L."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1986,12,1]]},"container-title-short":"AA"},

  {"id":"Sigurdsson1982","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Reinterpretation of the volcanological and historical evidence shows that the eruption of Vesuvius in A. D. 79 consisted of two main phases. The initial 18 to 20-hour Plinian phase caused extensive pumice-fall south of the volcano, resulting in the slow accumulation of a pumice layer up to 2.8 m. thick over Pompeii and other regions to the south. Much of the population fled the area during this non-lethal phase. On the second day of activity the Peléan phase occurred, when a series of nuées ardentes or hot ash-avalanches swept down the south and west flanks of the volcano, affecting the region as far as Misenum, 30 km. to the west. The first of two nuées ardentes which inundated Pompeii over-whelmed and asphyxiated those who remained above ground in the city and their bodies were immediately interred in the fine-grained deposit. The effects of the Peléan activity were even more severe west and north-west of Pompeii, resulting in burial of the cities of Oplontis and Herculaneum by a series of nuée ardente deposits.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.2307/504292","issue":"1","page":"39-51","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Eruption of Vesuvius in A.

  {"id":"Sandbrook1972","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Patrons, clients et factions: quelques dimensions nouvelles de l'analyse des conflits en Afrique. Cet article veut montrer que des notions comme celles de patron-client et de faction sont essentielles à la compréhension de plusieurs situations de conflit en Afrique. La notion de patron-client, qui est préférée aux notions voisines de << patronage >> et de << machine politique >>, peut être définie comme une relation duale, caractérisée par l'inégalité des statuts, la réciprocité et l'interaction de face à face. Un réseau de relations patron-client est fait d'une série de relations de ce type, formant une structure pyramidale dont les liaisons aboutissent en un centre, et ce parfois grâce à plusieurs patrons intermédiaires. Quant à la faction, on peut la définir comme le segment de ce réseau qui est apte à entrer en compétition pour obtenir de la richesse, du pouvoir et du statut à l'intérieur d'une organisation ou d'un territoire donné. L'importance en Afrique des divisions entre factions se laisse voir par les insuffisances même de deux modèles conceptuels qui sont souvent utilisées dans l'analyse des situations de conflit: le modèle qui se fonde sur les clivages ethniques ou << tribaux >>, et le modèle qui se fonde sur les conflits de classe. C'est seulement en introduisant des concepts comme ceux de patronclient et de faction qu'on peut rendre compte des anomalies observées en ces deux modèles. En conclusion, on s'interroge sur les conditions sociales, économiques et politiques ainsi que sur les conséquences de la << politique de clientèle >>. Une première conclusion provisoire veut que l'existence des factions à l'intérieur des armées, des partis, des organismes gouvernementaux, des syndicats, des coopératives et des associations tribales est à la fois une conséquence et une cause de leur faible degré d'institutionnalisation. Une seconde conclusion souligne la contradiction entre les appels publics qui demandent de se sacrifier dans l'intérêt de la nation à construire, et la pratique privée fort répandue qui consiste à établir, à la façon des mercenaires, des relations de client à patron. On note enfin que la politique de clientèle peut, dans certaines circonstances, contribuer à l'intégration politique, en jetant des ponts entre leaders de différents groupes ethniques et de différentes strates socio-économiques.","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique","issue":"1","page":"104-119","source":"JSTOR","title":"Patrons, Clients, and Factions: New Dimensions of Conflict Analysis in Africa","title-short":"Patrons, Clients, and Factions","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3231390","volume":"5","author":[{"family":"Sandbrook","given":"Richard"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1972,3,1]]}},

  {"id":"Steinby2007","type":"thesis","abstract":"Työ käsittelee Rooman laivaston kehitystä, toimintaa ja osallistumista laajenemispolitiikkaan, jossa Rooma kasvoi kaupunkivaltiosta Välimeren hallitsijaksi. Rooma on aikaisemmissa tutkimuksissa nähty maavaltiona vailla kiinnostusta merenkulkuun. On katsottu, että ainoa merkittävä merisota Rooman historiassa on ensimmäinen puunilaissota (264-241 eKr.) ja että siinäkin roomalaiset (jotka historioitsija Polybius kuvaa vasta-alkajiksi) menestyivät Karthagoa vastaan turvautumalla laskusiltoihin, joiden avulla he saattoivat muuttaa meritaistelun maataisteluksi. Polybiuksen kuvaukseen on aina tähän asti luotettu. On katsottu että Roomalla ei ollut laivastoa ennen ensimmäistä puunilaissotaa ja että Rooma kaikissa sodissaan panosti merisodankäyntiin mahdollisimman vähän. Tämä työ pyrkii kumoamaan nämä käsitykset. Laivasto oli osallisena ja ehdottoman välttämätön kaikissa Rooman laajenemispolitiikan käänteissä. Arkeologian tiedot osoittavat, että ennen ensimmäistä puunilaissotaa Rooma kehittyi ja siitä tuli merkittävä kaupunki nimenomaan kaupankäynnin ja ulkomaisten kontaktien seurauksena. Se ei siis ollut puhdas agraarivaltio. Roomalaisilla oli laivasto jo viimeistään 500-luvulta lähtien eKr. ja sitä käytettiin Rooman laajentaessa valtaansa Italiassa. Näin ollen ensimmäisessä puunilaissodassa läntisen Välimeren herruudesta kilpaili kaksi merivaltiota, Rooma ja Karthago. Toinen puunilaissota (218-201) tunnetaan yleensä Hannibalin tulosta Alppien yli Italiaan, mutta se oli myöskin merkittävä merisota ja karthagolaiset hävisivät sen nimenomaan merellä. Rooma osallistui kilpailuun itäisen Välimeren hallinnasta ja kukisti Makedonian ja Syyrian laivastot, jotka eivät olleet mitenkään Rooman laivaston veroisia. Kaikista Rooman vastustajista Karthagolla olisi ollut suurin mahdollisuus pysäyttää Rooman laivaston voittokulu toisessa puunilaissodassa. Laivastoa käytettiin moniin eri tarkoituksiin. Suuret meritaistelut eivät ole ainoa osoitus laivastojen mukanaolosta ja merkityksestä, v The present dissertation discusses the development of the Roman navy, how it functioned strategically and tactically, and the role it played in the expansion of Rome’s Mediterraenan dominion. In previous studies, scholars (especially J.H. Thiel, 1946 and 1954) have seen the Romans as a nation of ‘land-lubbers’ in the wars that they fought against Carthage, Macedon and Syria. The idea stems from the historian Polybius, who represents the Romans as beginners at sea in the First Punic War and states that they won by using boarding-bridges which enabled them to turn a battle at sea into a battle on land. Thus, the Romans have been represented as a nation avoiding seafaring and in terms of the discussion of warfare at sea, historians have disregarded other wars in which the Roman navy played an important role, concentrating on the First Punic War alone. The Roman navy was active and absolutely necessary at all stages of the expansion of Rome’s Mediterranean dominion. In the centuries before the First Punic War, commerce with the Greeks and the Phoenicians made Rome a prosperous city. The Romans were involved in commerce, warfare and piracy like any other nation in the Tyrrhenian area. The navy was used in the process of the conquest of the Italian peninsula, not only as an aid to the army, but it also functioned independently in a manner appropriate to a sea power. In the First Punic War (264-241), the Romans challenged the Carthaginians for thalassocracy over the western Mediterranean. The competition continued in the Second Punic War 218-201, in which the fleets played an equally crucial role. It was really at sea that the Carthaginians lost the Second Punic War. In the eastern Mediterranean, the Romans challenged and defeated the Macedonian and Seleucid fleets and became the masters of the eastern Mediterranean. The Macedonian and Seleucid fleets were no match for the Roman fleet and so, if anyone could have stopped the Roman navy, it should have been the Carthaginian","language":"English","note":"http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-653-350-9","publisher":"Suomen tiedeseura","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The Roman Republican Navy: from the sixth century to 167 BC","title-short":"The Roman Republican Navy","URL":"http://hdl.handle.net/10138/19199","author":[{"family":"Steinby","given":"Christa"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]}},

Involontairement, il révèle au contraire plusieurs traits typiquement étrusques en ce qui concerne les compétitions sportives: outre le refus de la nudité athlétique, on notera surtout l'existence de courses de triges, absolument inconnues en Grèce.

  {"id":"VENIT2006","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Vasen sind in attischen Vasenbildern häufig dargestellt, aber nur selten ist auf den gezeichneten Vasen eine Dekoration angegeben, durch Ritzung oder mit Glanzton. Wo sie vorhanden ist, erlaubt sie oft, auf das Material -Glas, Metall oder Ton -zu schliessen, indem die plastisch abgesetzten Teile des Gefässes oder sein Ornament angedeutet werden (Taf. 5, 1-5)-Sehr selten sind auch figürliche Szenen auf einer abgebildeten Vase zu entdecken. Dieser Beitrag bespricht attische schwarz-und rotfigurige Vasen mit figürlichen Darstellungen, oft narrativen Gehalts, und fragt nach der Bedeutung des ‹Bildes im Bilde›. In wenigen Fällen repliziert das fiktive Vasenbild einfach die Szene, von der es selber ein Teil ist. Häufiger wiederholt und bestärkt es auf andere Weise den Sinn, der dem grosseren Bild zugrundeliegt (Taf. 5, 6-7, 4). Besonders provokativ wirken jedoch jene gezeichneten Vasen, deren Darstellung den augenfälligen Inhalt des Hauptbildes subversiv zu untergraben scheint (Taf 8, 1; 9, 5; 10, 1-2). Fréquemment, les scènes décorant les vases attiques comportent des images de vases. Cependant, il est rare que ces vases en représentation portent une décoration peinte ou incisée. Lorsqu'elle est présente, cette décoration se borne souvent à suggérer le matériau dans lequel est fait le vase - verre, métal ou argile - en en soulignant les éléments formels ou les ornements qu'il est censé posséder (pl. 5, 1-5). Parmi les décorations peintes et incisées, très rares sont les scènes figurées. Cette étude se concentre sur les vases attiques à figures noires et à figures rouges décorés de scènes figuratives -et souvent narratives -en s'interrogeant notamment sur la signification de cette «mise en abîme» . Il arrive parfois que la scène en miniature reproduise fidèlement la grande image dans laquelle elle est insérée. Mais le plus souvent, ces simulacra portent des images qui répètent et renforcent, de quelque manière, la signification de la grande image (pl. 5, 6-7, 4). Enfin, certaines scènes en miniature semblent, non sans provocation, avoir pour but de subvenir le sens de la grande image et de saper la portée de son message (pl. 8, 1; 9, 5; 10, 1-2).","container-title":"Antike Kunst","page":"29-41","source":"JSTOR","title":"POINT AND COINTERPOINT: Painted Vases on Attic Painted Vases","title-short":"POINT AND COINTERPOINT","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41321336","volume":"49","author":[{"family":"VENIT","given":"MARJORIE SUSAN"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,26]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,1,1]]}},

  {"id":"Wells1990","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The \"Iron Age\" designates the 800 years preceding the Roman conquest of Europe. This period represents the latest social and cultural development of indigenous European societies before the annexation of much of temperate Europe into the Roman Empire and the final phase of cultural change before the beginning of local traditions of written history north of the Alps. Our understanding of the Iron Age has changed substantially over the past 30 years, as a result both of recent discoveries and of new perspectives. Much recent research has focused on specific themes such as changing social structure and patterns of ritual behavior. I attempt here to provide an overview of current understanding and debate on some of these topics in Iron Age archaeology. The subject and its literature are vast, and my treatment is selective. The references will guide the interested reader to the wider literature.","container-title":"Journal of World Prehistory","issue":"4","page":"437-476","source":"JSTOR","title":"Iron Age Temperate Europe: Some Current Research Issues","title-short":"Iron Age Temperate Europe","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25800588","volume":"4","author":[{"family":"Wells","given":"Peter S."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,26]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1990,12,1]]}},

To illustrate this we analyze the annual rankings produced by the Financial Times. This analysis illustrates that (a) these rankings are driven in large part by structural factors that many schools cannot change, (b) the ranks of the top schools are quite stable over time, and (c) the ranks of the bottom schools are quite dynamic. These effects provide a competitive advantage for the early entrants into the top ranks. Our research builds on the idea that the rankings are a social statistic that plays a crucial role in defining business school competition.","container-title":"European Management Review","DOI":"10.1057/emr.2008.14","ISSN":"1740-4762","issue":"4","page":"195–208","title":"The Financial Times business schools ranking: What quality is this signal of quality?","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/emr.2008.14","volume":"5","author":[{"family":"Devinney","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Dowling","given":"Grahame R."},{"family":"Perm-Ajchariyawong","given":"Nidthida"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]}},

The ancient Roman world was unaware of these risks. How far the gigantic network of lead pipes used in ancient Rome compromised public health in the city is unknown. Lead isotopes in sediments from the harbor of Imperial Rome register the presence of a strong anthropogenic component during the beginning of the Common Era and the Early Middle Ages. They demonstrate that the lead pipes of the water distribution system increased Pb contents in drinking water of the capital city by up to two orders of magnitude over the natural background. The Pb isotope record shows that the discontinuities in the pollution of the Tiber by lead are intimately entwined with the major issues affecting Late Antique Rome and its water distribution system.","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1400097111","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"18","language":"en","page":"6594-6599","source":"www.pnas.org.ezproxy.drew.edu","title":"Lead in ancient Rome’s city waters","URL":"http://www.pnas.org.ezproxy.drew.edu/content/111/18/6594","volume":"111","author":[{"family":"Delile","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Blichert-Toft","given":"Janne"},{"family":"Goiran","given":"Jean-Philippe"},{"family":"Keay","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Albarède","given":"Francis"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,8]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,6,5]]},"PMID":"24753588","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

Here we analyse a 5,000-year transect of human genomes, sampled from petrous bones giving consistently excellent endogenous DNA yields, from 13 Hungarian Neolithic, Copper, Bronze and Iron Age burials including two to high (~22 × ) and seven to ~1 × coverage, to investigate the impact of these on Europe’s genetic landscape. These data suggest genomic shifts with the advent of the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages, with interleaved periods of genome stability. The earliest Neolithic context genome shows a European hunter-gatherer genetic signature and a restricted ancestral population size, suggesting direct contact between cultures after the arrival of the first farmers into Europe. The latest, Iron Age, sample reveals an eastern genomic influence concordant with introduced Steppe burial rites.

  {"id":"Feldman2011","type":"book","abstract":"Much of what is written about colleges and universities ties rapidly rising tuition to dysfunctional behavior in the academy. Common targets of dysfunction include prestige games among universities, gold plated amenities, and bloated administration. This book offers a different view. To explain rising college cost, the authors place the higher education industry firmly within the larger economic history of the United States. The trajectory of college cost is similar to cost behavior in many other industries, and this is no coincidence. Higher education is a personal service that relies on highly educated labor. A technological trio of broad economic forces has come together in the last thirty years to cause higher education costs, and costs in many other industries, to rise much more rapidly than the inflation rate. The main culprit is economic growth itself. This finding does not mean that all is well in American higher education. A college education has become less reachable to a broad swathe of the American public at the same time that the market demand for highly educated people has soared. This affordability problem has deep roots. The authors explore how cost pressure, the changing wage structure of the US economy, and the complexity of financial aid policy combine to reduce access to higher education below what we need in the 21st century labor market. This book is a call to calm the rhetoric of blame and to instead find policies that will increase access to higher education while preserving the quality of our colleges and universities.","language":"English","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Why Does College Cost So Much?","URL":"http://www.myilibrary.com?id=300966&ref=toc","author":[{"family":"Feldman","given":"David H."},{"family":"Archibald","given":"Robert B."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,3]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]}},

  {"id":"Bauerlein2009","type":"report","abstract":"In higher education in the United States, teaching and research in the fields of language and literature are in a desperate condition. Laboring on the age-old axiom “publish-or-perish,” thousands of professors, lecturers, and graduate students are busy producing dissertations, books, essays, and reviews. Over the past five decades, their collective productivity has risen from 13,000 to 72,000 publications per year. But the audience for language and literature scholarship has diminished, with unit sales for books now hovering around 300.\n\nAt the same time, the relations between teachers and students have declined. While 43 percent of two-year public college students and 29 percent of four-year public college students require remedial coursework, costing $2 billion annually, one national survey reports that 37 percent of first-year arts/humanities students “never” discuss course readings with teachers outside of class, and 41 percent only do so “sometimes.”\n\nThese trends are not unrelated. Academic engagement on the part of students is a reflection of how much teachers demand it. But with the research mandate hovering over them, teachers have no incentive to push it. If the system favors publication, not mentoring, hours in the office in conversation with sophomores are counter-productive or even damaging to career and livelihood.\n\nUniversities need to reconsider the relative value placed on research and teaching in the evaluation of professors. This paper offers several recommendations, including limiting the amount of material that tenure committees will review and creating a “teacher track” in which doctoral students are trained and rewarded for generalist knowledge and multiple course facility rather than a highly-specialized expertise.","publisher":"American Enterprise Institute","title":"Professors on the Production Line, Students on their Own","URL":"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-5-JeCa2Z7hNjQ1YTNlODUtNmMyYi00ZjEzLWI0NDItYjBhYzMyODNlNDc0/edit","author":[{"family":"Bauerlein","given":"Mark"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1]]}},

In our experiment, assistant instructors in an online class each operated under two different gender identities.

Least Cost Paths (LCP) have been especially successful among them, most often with the objective of predicting or reconstructing the layout of ancient routes. In this paper we propose an alternate use of those tools, aimed at trying to identify the main locations taken into account when defining the routes, rather than at predicting or reconstructing them. Through a rather simple and straightforward methodological sequence, based on the successive testing of very explicit hypotheses, we show how this approach can produce significant new knowledge while dodging some typical issues of LCP analysis.

  {"id":"Cotner2013","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Several institutions have redesigned traditional learning spaces to better realize the potential of active, experiential learning. We compare student performance in traditional and active learning classrooms in a large, introductory biology course using the same syllabus, course goals, exams, and instructor. Using ACT scores as predictive, we found that students in the active learning classroom outperformed expectations, whereas those in the traditional classroom did not. By replicating initial work, our results provide empirical confirmation that new, technology-enhanced learning environments positively and independently affect student learning.

Using a quasi-experimental design, researchers partnered with an instructor who taught identical sections of the same course in two radically different formal learning environments to isolate the impact of the physical environment on student learning. The results of the study reveal that, holding all factors excepting the learning spaces constant, students taking the course in a technologically enhanced environment conducive to active learning techniques outperformed their peers who were taking the same course in a more traditional classroom setting. The evidence suggests strongly that technologically enhanced learning environments, independent of all other factors, have a significant and positive impact on student learning.","container-title":"British Journal of Educational Technology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01098.x","ISSN":"00071013","issue":"5","page":"719-726","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Space matters: The impact of formal learning environments on student learning","title-short":"Space matters","URL":"http://ezproxy.amherst.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=64866274&site=ehost-live&scope=site","volume":"42","author":[{"family":"Brooks","given":"D.

II suggerimento è basato sul 'consensus' che la Porta Romanula, cui fa riferimento Varrone, era situata 'all'angolo nord-ovest del Palatino nelle vicinanze del presente sito' (p. 274). Ciò che Varrone realmente dice è che la Porta Romanula era situata vicino a due siti nel Velabrum, in qualche modo legata all'uscita alia noua uia, e che il Velabrum era stato una volta uno sbarco per il traghetto dall'Aventino. Il supposto consensus implica che i traghetti dall'Aventino di cui parla Varrone approdavano presso il vicino Tempio di Vesta, il che e altamente improbabile. Nel presente articolo si argomenta (a) che il Velabrum era un toponimo specifico sulla strada che andava dal Foro al Circo Massimo (l'area di San Giorgio in Velabro), (b) che la narrazione del percorso di Otho dal Tempio di Apollo al milliarium aureum nel 69 d.C. non offre nessun supporto alia teoria del consensus, e pertanto (c) che non c'è nessuna ragione per supporre che la struttura spoliata di Hurst avesse qualcosa a che vedere con la Porta Romanula.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","ISSN":"0068-2462","page":"231-237","source":"JSTOR","title":"Where Was the Porta Romanula?","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40311120","volume":"75","author":[{"family":"Wiseman","given":"T.

  {"id":"Angrist2014","type":"report","abstract":"Does financial aid increase college attendance and completion? Selection bias and the high implicit tax rates imposed by overlapping aid programs make this question difficult to answer. This paper reports initial findings from a randomized evaluation of a large privately-funded scholarship program for applicants to Nebraska's public colleges and universities. Our research design answers the challenges of aid evaluation with random assignment of aid offers and a strong first stage for aid received: randomly assigned aid offers increased aid received markedly. This in turn appears to have boosted enrollment and persistence, while also shifting many applicants from two- to four-year schools. Awards offered to nonwhite applicants, to those with relatively low academic achievement, and to applicants who targeted less-selective four-year programs (as measured by admissions rates) generated the largest gains in enrollment and persistence, while effects were much smaller for applicants predicted to have stronger post-secondary outcomes in the absence of treatment. Thus, awards enabled groups with historically-low college attendance to ʽlevel up,ʼ largely equalizing enrollment and persistence rates with traditionally college-bound peers, particularly at four-year programs. Awards offered to prospective community college students had little effect on college enrollment or the type of college attended.","genre":"Working Paper","number":"20800","publisher":"National Bureau of Economic Research","source":"National Bureau of Economic Research","title":"Leveling Up: Early Results from a Randomized Evaluation of Post-Secondary Aid","title-short":"Leveling Up","URL":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w20800","author":[{"family":"Angrist","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Autor","given":"David"},{"family":"Hudson","given":"Sally"},{"family":"Pallais","given":"Amanda"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,21]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,12]]}},

  {"id":"Retief2003","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In antiquity crucifixion was considered one of the most brutal and shameful modes of death. Probably originating with the Assyrians and Babylonians, it was used systematically by the Persians in the 6th century BC. Alexander the Great brought it from there to the eastern Mediterranean countries in the 4th century BC, and the Phoenicians introduced it to Rome in the 3rd century BC. It was virtually never used in pre-Hellenic Greece. The Romans perfected crucifion for 500 years until it was abolished by Constantine I in the 4th century AD. Crucifixion in Roman times was applied mostly to slaves, disgraced soldiers, Christians and foreigners--only very rarely to Roman citizens. Death, usually after 6 hours--4 days, was due to multifactorial pathology: after-effects of compulsory scourging and maiming, haemorrhage and dehydration causing hypovolaemic shock and pain, but the most important factor was progressive asphyxia caused by impairment of respiratory movement. Resultant anoxaemia exaggerated hypovolaemic shock. Death was probably commonly precipitated by cardiac arrest, caused by vasovagal reflexes, initiated inter alia by severe anoxaemia, severe pain, body blows and breaking of the large bones. The attending Roman guards could only leave the site after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross to asphyxiate the victim.","container-title":"South African Medical Journal = Suid-Afrikaanse Tydskrif Vir Geneeskunde","ISSN":"0256-9574","issue":"12","language":"eng","page":"938-941","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"The history and pathology of crucifixion","URL":"http://www.samj.org.za/index.php/samj/article/view/2462/1710","volume":"93","author":[{"family":"Retief","given":"F.

Details of the practice, which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, have intrigued scholars as historical records and archaeological findings from the era are limited. As a result, various aspects of crucifixion, including the type of crosses used, methods of securing victims to crosses, the length of time victims survived on the cross, and the exact mechanisms of death, remain topics of debate. One aspect of crucifixion not previously explored in detail is the characteristic hand posture often depicted in artistic renditions of crucifixion. In this posture, the hand is clenched in a peculiar and characteristic fashion: there is complete failure of flexion of the thumb and index finger with partial failure of flexion of the middle finger. Such a “crucified clench” is depicted across different cultures and from different eras. A review of crucifixion history and techniques, median nerve anatomy and function, and the historical artistic depiction of crucifixion was performed to support the hypothesis that the “crucified clench” results from proximal median neuropathy due to positioning on the cross, rather than from direct trauma of impalement of the hand or wrist.","container-title":"Brain and Behavior","DOI":"10.1002/brb3.132","ISSN":"2162-3279","issue":"3","language":"en","page":"243-248","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Crucifixion and median neuropathy","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/brb3.132/abstract","volume":"3","author":[{"family":"Regan","given":"Jacqueline M."},{"family":"Shahlaie","given":"Kiarash"},{"family":"Watson","given":"Joseph C."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,17]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]}},

A new campaign of documentation has yielded many new insights about the character, chronological development, and historical importance of this local shrine. We analyze the date and appearance of the republican shrine and consider the extensive changes that Augustus made when he restored it with money donated to him by the people of Rome on 1 January 10 B.C.E. The original interpretation of the monument as a compital shrine made after its excavation in 1888 is no longer tenable; rather, the monument is our only in situ example of an Augustan New Year's dedication. The new analysis of the archaeological evidence for this particular shrine, considered within the broader context of other known examples of Augustus' New Year's monuments, not only highlights its unique aspects but also demonstrates what Augustus' intentions for these monuments were and the dynamics of imperial interaction at such a local level. It provides a much better understanding of a distinctly Augustan group of monuments than does the literary evidence alone.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.3764/aja.119.1.0047","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"1","page":"47-67","source":"JSTOR","title":"Mercury on the Esquiline: A Reconsideration of a Local Shrine Restored by Augustus","title-short":"Mercury on the Esquiline","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.119.1.0047","volume":"119","author":[{"family":"Andrews","given":"Margaret M."},{"family":"Flower","given":"Harriet I."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,20]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,1]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

This article approaches the issue through a body of evidence that has hitherto been overlooked: artificial port structures, such as jetties, quays, enclosures, and breakwaters. I identify 29 definite, and 16 possible, structures between Cyrenaica and Mauretania Tingitana dating between the fourth century B.C.E. and the sixth century C.E. I demonstrate that the archaeological evidence for these structures is a more reliable source of information than the ancient literary evidence and discuss how the picture drawn from the latter has misled earlier scholars. I argue that wharf length is the best measure of the size of port structures, and I use that concept to outline the role that individual ports and broader regions played in Mediterranean commerce. By relating artificial port structures to the major production centers of exported goods, I enhance the picture of the North African economy both before and during the Roman empire.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.3764/aja.118.4.0565","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"4","page":"565-600","source":"JSTOR","title":"Africa in the Roman Empire: Connectivity, the Economy, and Artificial Port Structures","title-short":"Africa in the Roman Empire","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.118.4.0565","volume":"118","author":[{"family":"Stone","given":"David L."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,20]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,1]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

A careful examination of their findspots and the dating of the statuettes show that this association is erroneous. In fact, the mouse statuettes were attached to bronze oil lamps, candelabra, lampstands, and other pieces of furniture. They refer directly to the common problem of mice gnawing at wicks and drinking lamp oil, a nuisance that is documented in various ancient texts. Mice were a popular motif that not only created a trompe l'oeil effect but also invoked Hellenistic and Roman literary and artistic traditions of an inverted world in which mice undertook human activities that were out of proportion to their small size.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.3764/aja.118.4.0601","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"4","page":"601-626","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Bronze Mice of Apollo Smintheus","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.118.4.0601","volume":"118","author":[{"family":"Kiernan","given":"Philip"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,20]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,1]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},
  {"id":"Gaignerot-Driessen2014","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract Large wheelmade terracotta figures with upraised arms, found together with typical cultic equipment, are characteristic of Cretan Postpalatial bench sanctuaries. It is generally assumed that these figures represent one or more deities and were used as cult images. Past and recent excavations on Crete illustrate a series of contexts that contain cultic equipment but lack such a figure with upraised arms. Most of these contexts date to Late Minoan (LM) IIIA–B and are found within larger building complexes that have potential communal functions. These complexes contrast with the contexts where the figures with upraised arms are found, which are freestanding public buildings and date to LM IIIB–C. This evolution suggests a change in the dynamics of and practices in cult spaces, an evolution that is here regarded as socially relevant. Within this framework, the figures with upraised arms are reconsidered as symbolic representations of votaries within the context of elite competition, rather than as cult images or cult statues.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.3764/aja.118.3.0489","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"3","page":"489-520","source":"JSTOR","title":"Goddesses Refusing to Appear?

  {"id":"Scopacasa2014","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract This article approaches gender as a means of understanding cultural identity in Italy before the Roman conquest. Most scholars have assumed based on written sources that the ancient inhabitants of Samnium, who are noted for their fierce resistance to Rome, shared a gender system in which men were primarily regarded as warriors and women as caretakers of the household. Archaeological support for this view has been sought in the contrast between burials containing weapons (assumed to belong to men) and those containing jewelry or personal ornaments (attributed to women). In line with recent studies that challenge such a view, I employ statistical methods to verify correlations between grave goods, sex, age, and social status. Results reveal that cultural attitudes toward gender among the Samnites were complex. In many cases, gender configurations were structured in such a way that both men and women performed similar social activities and may have participated as equals in commensal politics. These findings demonstrate the potential for quantitative archaeological analysis to enhance our knowledge of cultural identity and social organization in an area of the ancient world for which there is very little written evidence.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.3764/aja.118.2.0241","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"2","page":"241-266","source":"JSTOR","title":"Gender and Ritual in Ancient Italy: A Quantitative Approach to Grave Goods and Skeletal Data in Pre-Roman Samnium","title-short":"Gender and Ritual in Ancient Italy","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.118.2.0241","volume":"118","author":[{"family":"Scopacasa","given":"Rafael"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,20]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,1]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},
  {"id":"Andrews2014","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Abstract The crypt of the church of Santi Sergio e Bacco on Piazza Madonna dei Monti in Rome preserves the partial remains of a Roman structure showing multiple building phases. Tuff piers approximately 5 m tall belong to the atrium of a republican atrium house, with the surrounding rooms reflected in the adjacent spaces of the modern basement. During the Imperial period, this atrium was closed off, and a bath complex was added in adjacent rooms. The rooms preserve marble revetment, figural painted plaster of various styles, and floors of opus sectile. As a residential structure with a long occupation history, the house clarifies our impression of the lower Subura and its development as a neighborhood. When considered with other examples of atrium houses nearby, a standard lot size and house form for elite residential development can be suggested for the Subura and the southern Viminal slopes during the Republican period. Later renovations to the structure provide material evidence that a socially mixed population continued to occupy the valley of the Subura, and they demonstrate the persistent importance of the Argiletum as the primary thoroughfare of the area from the Imperial period through late antiquity.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.3764/aja.118.1.0061","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"1","page":"61-90","source":"JSTOR","title":"A Domus in the Subura of Rome from the Republic Through Late Antiquity","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.118.1.0061","volume":"118","author":[{"family":"Andrews","given":"Margaret M."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,20]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,1]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

It reveals a pattern for more than 40 of the most prolific vase painters. Each painter has approximately the same \"attribution rate,\" the average number of known vases per year of activity. However, several less productive painters have markedly lower attribution rates. An ethnographically based model predicts two primary modes of activity: specialized painters who were hired by master potters, and painters who also regularly threw their own vases. The evidence for potting is assessed for more than 60 painters to determine which of the modes they resemble. Almost every painter with evidence for specialization also has a high attribution rate, whereas low productivity is typical of the painters who spent part of their time potting. In conclusion, the attribution rate is used to argue for some combinations of hands and to examine the production and population of the Attic vase-painting industry as a whole. Fewer than 75 painters and potters were active by the Early Classical acme of the vase-painting industry.

  {"id":"Shalom-Guy2006","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This article examines the relationship between two parallel traditions that have the institution of calf worship at their nexus: the episode of the golden calf (Exodus 32) and the depiction of Jeroboam's reform (1 Kings 12:26-32). Strong topical and linguistic similarities demonstrate the existence of direct literary dependence between these two traditions. In shaping his critique of the northern kingdom's cult of calf worship, the author of the description of Jeroboam's reform utilized building blocks from the episode of the golden calf, embedding semiotic signposts in the body of the depiction. Intended for the perceptive reader with expertise in biblical literary traditions, these signposts facilitate discovery of the analogies between the traditions and the reaching of a correct, unfavorable understanding of this cult. Both the broad extent and nature of the similarities between the two stories indicate that these two traditions emerged from a single conceptual-literary framework, to be identified as a Judean, Deuteronomistic one, for which the centrality of Jerusalem and of its temple as the sole cultic center were of focal conceptual importance.","container-title":"Shnaton: An Annual for Biblical and Ancient Near Eastern Studies / שנתון לחקר המקרא והמזרח הקדום","ISSN":"0334-2891","page":"15-27","source":"JSTOR","title":"Jeroboam's Reform and the Episode of the Golden Calf / בין תיאור הרפורמה של ירבעם לפרשת העגל","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23412789","volume":"טז","author":[{"family":"Shalom-Guy","given":"Hava"},{"family":"שלום-גיא","given":"חוה"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,1,1]]}},

Several recent scholars (Cassuto, Greenberg, Childs, Kearney) have suggested, nonetheless, that the canonical sequence of events is meaningful.

It is also proposed that the sequence of events: command to build temple — rebellion — restoration of order — temple building is a traditional literary pattern since it is found in several Babylonian building accounts (Samsuiluna B, Nabu-šum-imbi, Nabonidus Harran B). These two features permit even the source-sensitive scholar to view Ex 25-40 as a preconceived literary unit aimed at presenting the Israelite 'Calf Cult' as a travesty of the legitimate cult practiced in the Jerusalem Temple.","container-title":"Shnaton: An Annual for Biblical and Ancient Near Eastern Studies / שנתון לחקר המקרא והמזרח הקדום","ISSN":"0334-2891","page":"51-59","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Golden Calf and the Tabernacle / העגל והמשכן","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23412836","volume":"ז/ח","author":[{"family":"Hurowitz","given":"V."},{"family":"הורוויץ","given":"אביגדור (ויקטור)"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1983,1,1]]}},

Moreover, this tablet addition offers a hopeful ending to the story thereby reversing the damning end of the underlying story. The damning underlying story seems to be the product of Hezekian (or Josianic) propaganda to explain the Assyrian destruction of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, while the tablet addition seems to be the product of the Exilic/ Post-Exilic priestly circle who offer a picture of hope following catastrophe (the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in about 587 B.C.E.).","container-title":"Hebrew Studies","ISSN":"0146-4094","page":"41-65","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Tablets of testimony and a reversal of outcome in the golden calf episode","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/27913924","volume":"50","author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Craig Evan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,1]]}},

This study suggests that Môt is not in fact depicted here as grain being \"harvested\" by 'Anat, and thus the passage may better be understood as representing the ritual destruction of a hostile deity.

Mot himself describes his own activity in the following words: \"as the lust of the lioness for the desert, as the yearning of the dolphin for the seas, as the buffalo panteth after the pools, and the hart panteth after the fountains of waters, so it is my desire to kill, to kill, so it is my pleasure to kill heaps upon heaps; with my two hands I do eat, seven portions they prepare for me, and a cup they fill for me, as big as a pitcher\" (I* AB, I, 14-22). And elsewhere: \"I was going and walking... and withdrawing life from men, life from the people of the earth\" (I AB, II, 15—19). It is said also that \"the rod of bereavement “and„ the rod of widowhood\" lie in his hand (SS, 8-9). Accordingly, Mot is not merely the Lord of the summer drought, but the Lord of Death, the personification of all the forces of destruction and annihilation of life. Therefore his abode is Sheol; in Sheol lies his city, in Sheol is found his throne; he is the king of the netherworld. He is often identified with Sheol: to enter the mouth of Mot means to descend to Sheol (I AB, II, 21-23; II AB, VIII, 15-25; I* AB, I, 19-22; II, 2-6). This view on the nature of Mot as the God of Death may be confirmed: a) by the character of his assistants: b) by the statement of Philo of Byblos; c) by the Biblical parallels relating to Mawet. As to Ba'al, he is not only the Lord of the Rain, but the god of Life in general. The fertility of cattle (No. 68, 27-29; I* AB, II, 16-17, 22-23) and of human beings (II D, I, 17 ff.) depends on him; he \"feedeth gods and men\" (II AB, VII, 49-50). His chief assistants are his sister ʿAnat, the Goddess of Life and Kathir-wa-Hasis, who personifies the creative forces of man. Accordingly, the struggle between Baʿal and Mot, represented as a competition for the throne, symbolizes the struggle between the forces of Life and the forces of Death in the world. Both tried to obtain dominion over the world, but in the end, notwithstanding all opposition and hindrances, the forces of Life emerge victorious and rule for ever.","container-title":"Bulletin of the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society / ידיעות החברה העברית לחקירת ארץ-ישראל ועתיקותיה","ISSN":"2312-0096","issue":"ב'/ג'","page":"45-51","source":"JSTOR","title":"Ba'al and Môt in the Texts of Ugarit / בעל ומת בכתבי אוגרית","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23725136","volume":"ט'","author":[{"family":"Cassuto","given":"U."},{"family":"קאסוטו","given":"מ. ד. א."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,23]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1942,1,1]]}},

  {"id":"Duggan2005","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Tuition discounting began in the 1970s as the practice of using university funds to augment federal, state, and private aid and scholarships. When the 1980s saw a decrease in the number of high school seniors, universities began to compete in the arena of price for the first time, sparking what has been called an \"arms race\" of tuition discounting (Goral 2003). Recently, tuition discounting has changed in two main respects. The first, which has faced the most public criticism, is that discounts are no longer based solely on financial need. The second, even more risky, change in tuition discounting is in the methods institutions of higher education use to fund their discounts. This practice has the potential to undermine the financial stability of a college, not to mention limit funds for instruction, academics, and student support (Goral 2003). Today, price competition is a reality one must live with, and so assessing one's peers' discounting practices is an important tool. The federal government, through the National Center for Education Statistics' Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), collects a variety of data from higher education institutions. The data that are collected are made available to the higher education community and the public through the IPEDS Peer Analysis System (PAS). The Peer Analysis System allows users to compare an institution (called a linchpin in PAS) with other colleges and universities (peer group).","container-title":"College and University","ISSN":"0010-0889","issue":"3","language":"en","page":"43-45","source":"ERIC","title":"Using the IPEDS Peer Analysis System to Compare Tuition Discount Rates","volume":"80","author":[{"family":"Duggan","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Mathews","given":"Rebecca"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,28]]},"issued":{"literal":"2005/00/00"}},

  {"id":"Epstein2009","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The advent of the modern form of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), brought to bear by the combination of the Educational Testing Service (ETS) and Harvard's former president James Bryant Conant (Lemann 1999), was designed to promote the recognition of talent and intellect, wherever they may be found. Their aim was to provide greater educational access for academically gifted and accomplished students, requiring students at elite institutions to prove their worthiness by performance rather than merely by pedigree. Within a few short years, it began to clarify the distinction between social and intellectual elite. During the 1950s, use of the SAT grew rapidly. When the University of California adopted the exam in 1968, its expansion across the nation was solidified. In 1990, from a desire to move away from the idea that the test measures innate ability, its intent mid-century, the SAT changed its acronym to the Scholastic Assessment Test. This move marked a formal break from its early 1920s precursors that were forms of IQ tests. Then, faced with challenges to the claim that it truly measured achievement, in 1994 it removed the acronym entirely, keeping only the initials SAT. This article discusses the following: (1) how SAT is used in the present times; (2) the dawning and dominance of the importance of scoring; (3) the threat of SAT-optional movement; (4) the critiques within higher education of SAT-optional policies; and (5) the advocacy efforts made by Fair Test: The National Center for Fair and Open Testing in encouraging schools to adopt SAT-optional policies. A possible solution that addresses some major concerns about the SAT while utilizing its major strengths is also discussed.","container-title":"Journal of College Admission","ISSN":"0734-6670","language":"en","page":"8-19","source":"ERIC","title":"Behind the SAT-Optional Movement: Context and Controversy","title-short":"Behind the SAT-Optional Movement","URL":"http://eric.ed.gov/?q=behind+the+sat+optional&id=EJ856358","volume":"204","author":[{"family":"Epstein","given":"Jonathan P."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,30]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]],"season":2}},

  {"id":"Hoxby2012","type":"report","abstract":"We show that the vast majority of very high-achieving students who are low-income do not apply to any selective college or university. This is despite the fact that selective institutions would often cost them less, owing to generous financial aid, than the resource-poor two-year and non-selective four-year institutions to which they actually apply. Moreover, high-achieving, low-income students who do apply to selective institutions are admitted and graduate at high rates. We demonstrate that these low-income students' application behavior differs greatly from that of their high-income counterparts who have similar achievement. The latter group generally follows the advice to apply to a few \"par\" colleges, a few \"reach\" colleges, and a couple of \"safety\" schools. We separate the low-income, high-achieving students into those whose application behavior is similar to that of their high-income counterparts (\"achievement-typical\" behavior) and those whose apply to no selective institutions (\"income-typical\" behavior). We show that income-typical students do not come from families or neighborhoods that are more disadvantaged than those of achievement-typical students. However, in contrast to the achievement-typical students, the income-typical students come from districts too small to support selective public high schools, are not in a critical mass of fellow high achievers, and are unlikely to encounter a teacher or schoolmate from an older cohort who attended a selective college. We demonstrate that widely-used policies-college admissions staff recruiting, college campus visits, college access programs-are likely to be ineffective with income-typical students, and we suggest policies that will be effective must depend less on geographic concentration of high achievers.","genre":"Working Paper","number":"18586","publisher":"National Bureau of Economic Research","source":"National Bureau of Economic Research","title":"The Missing","URL":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18586","author":[{"family":"Hoxby","given":"Caroline M."},{"family":"Avery","given":"Christopher"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12]]}},

Rates of college completion increased by only four percentage points for low-income cohorts born around 1980 relative to cohorts born in the early 1960s, but by 18 percentage points for corresponding cohorts who grew up in high-income families. Among men, inequality in educational attainment has increased slightly since the early 1980s. But among women, inequality in educational attainment has risen sharply, driven by increases in the education of the daughters of high-income parents. Sex differences in educational attainment, which were small or nonexistent thirty years ago, are now substantial, with women outpacing men in every demographic group. The female advantage in educational attainment is largest in the top quartile of the income distribution.

ROMAGNOLI 2001. 2 Le ricerche si svolgono sulla base di concessioni annuali di scavo rila- sciate dalla Soprintendenza per l’Etruria Meridionale. Va ricordato il costante sostegno assicurato al pro- getto dalla Soprintendente Anna Maria Sgubini Moretti e dai funzio- nari archeologi Irene Berlingò e Va- leria D’Atri. 3 Cfr. PAVOLINI 2007-2008; PALAZZO, PAVOLINI 2008. Il contesto storico-ur- banistico del municipium romano si va comunque precisando solo molto lentamente, come un mosaico che manchi ancora di gran parte dei tas- selli fondamentali: basti dire che a tutt’oggi non abbiamo nessuna idea sicura circa l’ubicazione del Foro (al- cune ipotesi in merito sono in ROMA- GNOLI 2006, p. 64). 4 L’esperienza di tali cantieri - che a Ferento si articolarono in cinque cam- pagne di scavo, svoltesi dal 1957 al 1961 - è descritta con precisione da G. Romagnoli (ROMAGNOLI 2001, pp. 294-295, e v. la sua fig. 2 per una rappresentazione schematica delle aree scavate anno per anno). Per quel che ci riguarda più direttamente, se ne ricava che nel 1957 fu interessato dai lavori il solo settore a Nord-Ovest del Teatro, e che, in particolare, la domus dell’attuale Saggio III venne sterrata nell’agosto di quell’anno. saggi, con perimetrazioni che hanno però valore solo generale e indicativo. La zona di scavo posta più diret- tamente sotto la mia direzione scien- tifica è il Saggio III, immediatamente a Ovest del Teatro. Nel presente inter- vento tratterò dunque solo di que- st’area, o meglio di un suo specifico elemento (il più importante, o quanto meno il più “visibile”): la domus ad atrio che si impiantò nel sito in età ro- mana. Va però precisato che il Saggio III si compone a sua volta di due set- tori (Nord-Ovest e Sud-Est), occupati rispettivamente, nel periodo che ci in- teressa, dall’edificio residenziale ap- pena menzionato - affacciato a Nord sulla via comunemente identificata col Decumano massimo della città - e da un poderoso impianto di cisterne certamente pubbliche, addossate al Teatro, delle quali non tratterò detta- gliatamente in questa sede (ma le in- contreremo di nuovo in sede conclusiva: v. infra, e fig. 7). I due settori erano divisi da una stretta strada, una traversa del Decumano. Va detto inoltre che, nel suo in- sieme, l’area corrispondente al Saggio III era stata già precedentemente esplorata in età moderna, e anzi pe- santemente compromessa.

  {"id":"Samsel2013","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Celiac disease, and, more generally, gluten intolerance, is a growing problem worldwide, but especially in North America and Europe, where an estimated 5% of the population now suffers from it. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, macrocytic anemia and depression. It is a multifactorial disease associated with numerous nutritional deficiencies as well as reproductive issues and increased risk to thyroid disease, kidney failure and cancer. Here, we propose that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, Roundup(®), is the most important causal factor in this epidemic. Fish exposed to glyphosate develop digestive problems that are reminiscent of celiac disease. Celiac disease is associated with imbalances in gut bacteria that can be fully explained by the known effects of glyphosate on gut bacteria. Characteristics of celiac disease point to impairment in many cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved with detoxifying environmental toxins, activating vitamin D3, catabolizing vitamin A, and maintaining bile acid production and sulfate supplies to the gut. Glyphosate is known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Deficiencies in iron, cobalt, molybdenum, copper and other rare metals associated with celiac disease can be attributed to glyphosate's strong ability to chelate these elements. Deficiencies in tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine and selenomethionine associated with celiac disease match glyphosate's known depletion of these amino acids. Celiac disease patients have an increased risk to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which has also been implicated in glyphosate exposure. Reproductive issues associated with celiac disease, such as infertility, miscarriages, and birth defects, can also be explained by glyphosate. Glyphosate residues in wheat and other crops are likely increasing recently due to the growing practice of crop desiccation just prior to the harvest. We argue that the practice of \"ripening\" sugar cane with glyphosate may explain the recent surge in kidney failure among agricultural workers in Central America. We conclude with a plea to governments to reconsider policies regarding the safety of glyphosate residues in foods.","container-title":"Interdisciplinary Toxicology","DOI":"10.2478/intox-2013-0026","ISSN":"1337-6853","issue":"4","language":"eng","page":"159-184","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Glyphosate, pathways to modern diseases II: Celiac sprue and gluten intolerance","title-short":"Glyphosate, pathways to modern diseases II","volume":"6","author":[{"family":"Samsel","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Seneff","given":"Stephanie"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12]]},"PMID":"24678255","PMCID":"PMC3945755"},

  {"id":"Barone2013","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper presents the results of a ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey conducted in the rural area of the ancient city of Ferento near Viterbo (Northern Latium, Italy), where the visible ruins testify an uninterrupted history from the Etruscan to the Medieval period. The soil covering the ruins has been intensively ploughed, cultivated and used for pasture over the centuries, and is characterised by a high content of clay minerals. In this scenario, the use of GPR is particularly difficult due to both possible ‘false positive anomalies’ and strong signal attenuation. In order to reconstruct the geometrical shape and size of the geophysical anomalies related to a medieval dwelling, multi-profile GPR data were collected in two different areas, using radar equipped with 250-MHz antennas. 2D and pseudo-3D migrated maps were created and signal velocity analysis was performed to estimate the target depths. Despite the clayey-calcareous material, the results show a good signal penetration and allow a clear reconstruction of the shape of the buried ruins, confirming that the anomalies are due to medieval buildings located at a depth in agreement with what was observed on the archaeological stratigraphy. Furthermore, our study suggests that in radar data interpretation, caution should be used if the surveyed area was subjected to prolonged and intensive agriculture.","container-title":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","DOI":"10.1007/s12520-013-0138-3","ISSN":"1866-9557, 1866-9565","issue":"3","language":"en","page":"267-273","source":"link.springer.com.ezproxy.amherst.edu","title":"Non-invasive archaeological exploration in stratigraphically complex rural settings: an example from Ferento (Viterbo, Italy)","title-short":"Non-invasive archaeological exploration in stratigraphically complex rural settings","URL":"http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.amherst.edu/article/10.1007/s12520-013-0138-3","volume":"5","author":[{"family":"Barone","given":"P.

  {"id":"Gaddis2014","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Racial inequality in economic outcomes, particularly among the college educated, persists throughout US society. Scholars debate whether this inequality stems from racial differences in human capital (e.g., college selectivity, GPA, college major) or employer discrimination against black job candidates. However, limited measures of human capital and the inherent difficulties in measuring discrimination using observational data make determining the cause of racial differences in labor-market outcomes a difficult endeavor. In this research, I examine employment opportunities for white and black graduates of elite top-ranked universities versus high-ranked but less selective institutions. Using an audit design, I create matched candidate pairs and apply for 1,008 jobs on a national job-search website. I also exploit existing birth-record data in selecting names to control for differences across social class within racialized names. The results show that although a credential from an elite university results in more employer responses for all candidates, black candidates from elite universities only do as well as white candidates from less selective universities. Moreover, race results in a double penalty: When employers respond to black candidates, it is for jobs with lower starting salaries and lower prestige than those of white peers. These racial differences suggest that a bachelor's degree, even one from an elite institution, cannot fully counteract the importance of race in the labor market. Thus, both discrimination and differences in human capital contribute to racial economic inequality.","container-title":"Social Forces","DOI":"10.1093/sf/sou111","ISSN":"0037-7732, 1534-7605","language":"en","source":"CrossRef","title":"Discrimination in the Credential Society: An Audit Study of Race and College Selectivity in the Labor Market","title-short":"Discrimination in the Credential Society","URL":"http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1093/sf/sou111","volume":"sou111","author":[{"family":"Gaddis","given":"S.

  {"id":"Turfa2014","type":"book","abstract":"The Etruscans can be shown to have made significant, and in some cases perhaps the first, technical advances in the central and northern Mediterranean. To the Etruscan people we can attribute such developments as the tie-beam truss in large wooden structures, surveying and engineering drainage and water tunnels, the development of the foresail for fast long-distance sailing vessels, fine techniques of metal production and other pyrotechnology, post-mortem C-sections in medicine, and more. In art, many technical and iconographic developments, although they certainly happened first in Greece or the Near East, are first seen in extant Etruscan works, preserved in the lavish tombs and goods of Etruscan aristocrats. These include early portraiture, the first full-length painted portrait, the first perspective view of a human figure in monumental art, specialized techniques of bronze-casting, and reduction-fired pottery (the bucchero phenomenon). Etruscan contacts, through trade, treaty and intermarriage, linked their culture with Sardinia, Corsica and Sicily, with the Italic tribes of the peninsula, and with the Near Eastern kingdoms, Greece and the Greek colonial world, Iberia, Gaul and the Punic network of North Africa, and influenced the cultures of northern Europe.  In the past fifteen years striking advances have been made in scholarship and research techniques for Etruscan Studies. Archaeological and scientific discoveries have changed our picture of the Etruscans and furnished us with new, specialized information. Thanks to the work of dozens of international scholars, it is now possible to discuss topics of interest that could never before be researched, such as Etruscan mining and metallurgy, textile production, foods and agriculture. In this volume, over 60 experts provide insights into all these aspects of Etruscan culture, and more, with many contributions available in English for the first time to allow the reader access to research that may not otherwise be available to them. Lavishly illustrated, The Etruscan World brings to life the culture and material past of the Etruscans and highlights key points of development in research, making it essential reading for researchers, academics and students of this fascinating civilization.","ISBN":"1-134-05530-7","language":"en","note":"00000","number-of-pages":"2404","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"The Etruscan World","editor":[{"family":"Turfa","given":"Jean MacIntosh"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,13]]}},

  {"id":"Wilson2012","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper examines the evidence for Saharan trade in the Roman period in the light of recent fieldwork in the Libyan Sahara by the Fazzan Project and the Desert Migrations Project and by the Italian Mission in the Acacus. The results of these projects suggest that trade between the Roman world and the communities of the Sahara was substantially greater than believed a few years ago and highlight the transformative effect that contact with the ancient Mediterranean had on Saharan society, especially on the Garamantes of Fazzan. But this paper also argues that in focusing chiefly on trans-Saharan commerce, much previous research has misunderstood the nature and importance of Saharan trade in antiquity. Relatively few types of goods were traded all the way across the Sahara from south to north or vice-versa in the Roman period. Rather, we should be thinking principally in terms of a network of interdependent sub-systems, of short-, medium- and long-distance exchange; the trans-Saharan traffic was only one part of this network. Moreover, Saharan trade — and especially the short- and medium-distance subsystems — also provoked transformations in the frontier zones of Roman North Africa. The abundant evidence of Roman imports to Fazzan discovered by British fieldwork there also calls into question the universal assumption that trans-Saharan trade in the medieval and modern periods exceeded the scale of trans-Saharan trade in antiquity; this is based on no good evidence at all and may be entirely false. Comparison with better documented periods suggests that the Roman world was capable of absorbing a trans-Saharan slave traffic at least as large as that of the medieval period and the evidence of Roman imports points to a substantial trade, of which slaves were probably a major component, via the central routes across the Sahara. Saharan trade in antiquity was organised around a set of drivers that were very different from those of the medieval trans-Saharan trade, with a key role played by the development of a substantial agriculturally-based trading state within the Sahara itself, the Garamantes. The collapse of Saharan trade in late antiquity is related to the decline of Garamantian authority and is linked in part to the emergence of new tribal conglomerations in the frontier zones between the fourth and sixth centuries AD.","container-title":"Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa","DOI":"10.1080/0067270X.2012.727614","ISSN":"0067-270X","issue":"4","page":"409-449","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Saharan trade in the Roman period: short-, medium- and long-distance trade networks","title-short":"Saharan trade in the Roman period","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0067270X.2012.727614","volume":"47","author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Andrew"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,11]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,1]]}},

We used samples of resins of different origin and ages, ranging from present-day to Triassic (225 million years ago (Ma)), in order to extend the knowledge of thermal patterns of very ancient resins. Under differential thermogravimetric analysis, all the samples presented a main exothermal event, whose temperature varied among resins of different age. The increasing value of the main exothermal peak varies with the increase of the age of the specimen and a significant linear correlation was found (r=0.701, P&lt;0.01) with a slope of 0.216. Additional information came in relation to paleobotanical origin, lithology and diagenesis of the fossil samples.\n\nThermal analysis of fossil resins appears therefore as a useful method that may improve the characterization of fossil resins and well correlates with the maturation grade.","container-title":"Thermochimica Acta","DOI":"10.1016/S0040-6031(03)00062-5","ISSN":"0040-6031","issue":"1–2","page":"43-54","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Classification of amber based on thermal analysis","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040603103000625","volume":"404","author":[{"family":"Ragazzi","given":"Eugenio"},{"family":"Roghi","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Giaretta","given":"Aurelio"},{"family":"Gianolla","given":"Piero"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,4]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,9,4]]}},

We can relate one globe-spanning group of fossil resins to the modern genus Agathis, based on spectral evolution over time. A second large group has not been related with certainty to specific modern plants. Fossil resins from Europe fall into two categories, the famous Baltic ambers and another that resembles the Agathis group. Fossil resins from the Americas and Africa are closely related to the modern genus Hymenaea.

  {"id":"Truica2014","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Increased need for non-destructive investigation methods in archaeology has become a major issue since sampling is in most cases restricted in view of the importance or uniqueness of the objects. For this reason, preliminary investigation using non-destructive techniques was performed on five samples of amber beads obtained from different excavation and archaeological sites. The use of FTIR and micro-Raman analysis revealed the presence of carboxyl, peroxide, hydroxyl, and complex ester functional groups as well as single and double bonds in the structure of the studied resin varieties. Further analysis of the amber samples from both archaeological and geological types by XPS, XRF, and SEM showed the presence of sulfur and a wide range of trace elements on the surface of the analysed samples. Our results proved that the combination of structural-molecular and surface elemental techniques for amber characterisation provides a very useful and simple methodology for the description of geological and archaeological amber samples from different regions of Europe.","container-title":"Chemical Papers","DOI":"10.2478/s11696-013-0415-8","issue":"1","page":"15-21","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"A multi-analytical approach to amber characterisation","URL":"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/chempap.2014.68.issue-1/s11696-013-0415-8/s11696-013-0415-8.xml","volume":"68","author":[{"family":"Truică","given":"Georgiana"},{"family":"Ditaranto","given":"Nicoletta"},{"family":"Caggiani","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Mangone","given":"Annarosa"},{"family":"Liţescu","given":"Simona"},{"family":"Teodor","given":"Eugenia"},{"family":"Sabbatini","given":"Luigia"},{"family":"Radu","given":"Gabriel"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,4]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,1]]}},

  {"id":"Gillett2010","type":"paper-conference","abstract":"According to ancient historians, the duodecim populi of Etruria formed a federal league for political, military and religious purposes. This paper will review how the 'Etruscan league' has been constructed in ancient sources and how it is perceived in our contemporary scholarship. It will explore the possibility of a pan-Etruscan league and will propose that temporary coalitions and localised alliances were formed between some Etruscan cities. This reconsideration of the evidence will question the league's existence and the political formation of pre-Roman Italic peoples, suggesting that we have perhaps relied too heavily on Graeco-Roman accounts and have disregarded the Etruscan evidence (or lack thereof).","container-title":"ASCS 31 [2010] Proceedings","language":"EN","page":"9","title":"The ‘Etruscan League’ Reconsidered","URL":"http://msc.uwa.edu.au/classics/ascs31","author":[{"family":"Gillett","given":"Miriam"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,2]]},"publisher-place":"Perth"},
  {"id":"Pollard1998","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Questo articolo discute due frammenti di scultura, uno di una scena di banchetto e l'altro rappresentante un gladiatore, attualmente localizzati nella moderna città - e precedente colonia romana — di Saturnia. I frammenti provengono da una grande villa tardo repubblicana/alto imperiale situata nei dintorni della città. L'evidenza epigrafica suggerisce che questa villa potrebbe essere appartenuta ad una famiglia locale (probabilmente di decurioni), i Varii. La scultura potrebbe derivare dalla tomba monumentale di un membro di quella famiglia. Sia banchetti che gladiatori sono comunemente rappresentati su monumenti funerari romani, e rappresentano anche una componente comune di opere civiche di beneficenza. Il materiale epigrafico di Saturnia rappresenta un'importante evidenza di euergetismo nel principato, e la scultura funeraria proviene da quel contesto culturale. L'evidenza di euergetismo a Saturnia fa riferimento alla continua stretta relazione fra proprietari terrieri locali e la vita civica, per il tramite del principato. Ciò è in contrasto con quanto avveniva nella bassa valle dell'Albegna, dove, fin dai tempi di Augusto, i proprietari che non risiedono nelle sue terre avevano mostrato scarsa partecipazione alla vita civica.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.2307/40310975","ISSN":"00682462","issue":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: 1998 / Copyright © 1998 British School at Rome","page":"57-70","title":"Art, Benefaction and Élites in Roman Etruria.

  {"id":"Benelli2014","type":"chapter","abstract":"The Etruscans can be shown to have made significant, and in some cases perhaps the first, technical advances in the central and northern Mediterranean. To the Etruscan people we can attribute such developments as the tie-beam truss in large wooden structures, surveying and engineering drainage and water tunnels, the development of the foresail for fast long-distance sailing vessels, fine techniques of metal production and other pyrotechnology, post-mortem C-sections in medicine, and more. In art, many technical and iconographic developments, although they certainly happened first in Greece or the Near East, are first seen in extant Etruscan works, preserved in the lavish tombs and goods of Etruscan aristocrats. These include early portraiture, the first full-length painted portrait, the first perspective view of a human figure in monumental art, specialized techniques of bronze-casting, and reduction-fired pottery (the bucchero phenomenon). Etruscan contacts, through trade, treaty and intermarriage, linked their culture with Sardinia, Corsica and Sicily, with the Italic tribes of the peninsula, and with the Near Eastern kingdoms, Greece and the Greek colonial world, Iberia, Gaul and the Punic network of North Africa, and influenced the cultures of northern Europe.  In the past fifteen years striking advances have been made in scholarship and research techniques for Etruscan Studies. Archaeological and scientific discoveries have changed our picture of the Etruscans and furnished us with new, specialized information. Thanks to the work of dozens of international scholars, it is now possible to discuss topics of interest that could never before be researched, such as Etruscan mining and metallurgy, textile production, foods and agriculture. In this volume, over 60 experts provide insights into all these aspects of Etruscan culture, and more, with many contributions available in English for the first time to allow the reader access to research that may not otherwise be available to them. Lavishly illustrated, The Etruscan World brings to life the culture and material past of the Etruscans and highlights key points of development in research, making it essential reading for researchers, academics and students of this fascinating civilization.","container-title":"The Etruscan World","ISBN":"1-134-05530-7","language":"en","note":"00000","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"Slavery and manumission","editor":[{"family":"Turfa","given":"Jean MacIntosh"}],"author":[{"family":"Benelli","given":"Enrico"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,13]]}},

  {"id":"Williams2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"National randomized experiments and validation studies were conducted on 873 tenure-track faculty (439 male, 434 female) from biology, engineering, economics, and psychology at 371 universities/colleges from 50 US states and the District of Columbia. In the main experiment, 363 faculty members evaluated narrative summaries describing hypothetical female and male applicants for tenure-track assistant professorships who shared the same lifestyle (e.g., single without children, married with children). Applicants' profiles were systematically varied to disguise identically rated scholarship; profiles were counterbalanced by gender across faculty to enable between-faculty comparisons of hiring preferences for identically qualified women versus men. Results revealed a 2:1 preference for women by faculty of both genders across both math-intensive and non–math-intensive fields, with the single exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Results were replicated using weighted analyses to control for national sample characteristics. In follow-up experiments, 144 faculty evaluated competing applicants with differing lifestyles (e.g., divorced mother vs. married father), and 204 faculty compared same-gender candidates with children, but differing in whether they took 1-y-parental leaves in graduate school. Women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers; men preferred mothers who took leaves to mothers who did not. In two validation studies, 35 engineering faculty provided rankings using full curricula vitae instead of narratives, and 127 faculty rated one applicant rather than choosing from a mixed-gender group; the same preference for women was shown by faculty of both genders. These results suggest it is a propitious time for women launching careers in academic science. Messages to the contrary may discourage women from applying for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) tenure-track assistant professorships.","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1418878112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","note":"00000","page":"201418878","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track","title-short":"National hiring experiments reveal 2","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/04/08/1418878112","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Wendy M."},{"family":"Ceci","given":"Stephen J."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,13]]},"PMID":"25870272","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

They call for a re-interpretation of his factoring of reader judgments (1961), his analytical scale for student essays (1966), and his measuring of student growth in writing (1974). The pieces also depict Diederich as an intricate and sometimes conflicted thinker, who always saw school writing performance and measurement in terms of the psychological, social, and ethical.

This paradigm shift has been brought about in large part by widespread access to tailored computer software which provides users with powerful tools for complex statistical inference with little need to learn about statistical modelling or computer programming. As a result, we run the risk that such software will be reduced to the status of black boxes. This would be a dangerous position for our community since good, principled use of Bayesian methods requires mindfulness when selecting the initial model, defining prior information, checking the reliability and sensitivity of the software runs and interpreting the results obtained.

  {"id":"Rasmussen2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Kennewick Man, referred to as the Ancient One by Native Americans, is a male human skeleton discovered in Washington state (USA) in 1996 and initially radiocarbon-dated to 8,340-9,200 calibrated years before present (bp). His population affinities have been the subject of scientific debate and legal controversy. Based on an initial study of cranial morphology it was asserted that Kennewick Man was neither Native American nor closely related to the claimant Plateau tribes of the Pacific Northwest, who claimed ancestral relationship and requested repatriation under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The morphological analysis was important to judicial decisions that Kennewick Man was not Native American and that therefore NAGPRA did not apply. Instead of repatriation, additional studies of the remains were permitted. Subsequent craniometric analysis affirmed Kennewick Man to be more closely related to circumpacific groups such as the Ainu and Polynesians than he is to modern Native Americans. In order to resolve Kennewick Man/'s ancestry and affiliations, we have sequenced his genome to [sim]1× coverage and compared it to worldwide genomic data including the Ainu and Polynesians. We find that Kennewick Man is closer to modern Native Americans than to any other population worldwide. Among the Native American groups for whom genome-wide data are available for comparison, several seem to be descended from a population closely related to that of Kennewick Man, including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville), one of the five tribes claiming Kennewick Man. We revisit the cranial analyses and find that, as opposed to genomic-wide comparisons, it is not possible on that basis to affiliate Kennewick Man to specific contemporary groups. We therefore conclude based on genetic comparisons that Kennewick Man shows continuity with Native North Americans over at least the last eight millennia.","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature14625","ISSN":"0028-0836","language":"en","note":"00000","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The ancestry and affiliations of Kennewick Man","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vnfv/ncurrent/full/nature14625.html","author":[{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"Morten"},{"family":"Sikora","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Albrechtsen","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Korneliussen","given":"Thorfinn Sand"},{"family":"Moreno-Mayar","given":"J.

We discuss the historical relationship between that Christian affirmation and expectation of divine aid and the common Arabic Islamic expression inshallah (\"if/when Allah wills\"). Philological and historical investigation indicates that \"God willing\" can be traced back through Christian triumphal affirmations to classical Latin and koine (New Testament) Greek commonplace expressions. The ultimate origin may well be a classical Greek Stoic expression which made its way into common parlance. We propose that the philological, semantic, and historical evidence suggests that Arabic inshallah may well have been an Islamic adoption of a Latin and/or Greek phrase encountered in the era of the Crusades.","container-title":"Neophilologus","DOI":"10.1007/s11061-011-9252-6","ISSN":"0028-2677, 1572-8668","issue":"3","language":"en","note":"00000","page":"373-378","source":"CrossRef","title":"“God Willing”: Really?

  {"id":"Flower1998","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This article offers a detailed analysis of the penalties imposed on Cn. Calpurnius Piso pater in AD 20 after he had been posthumously convicted of maiestas (treason). Piso was accused of leaving his province (Syria) without permission and then returning to try to retake it after the death of Germanicus in AD 19. He was also believed by many to be implicated in the death of Germanicus. The details of his case have been revealed by a new inscription from Spain, the Senatus Consultum de Cn. Pisone patre, which was first published in 1996. Part of this long and well-preserved inscription records the post-mortem sanctions against memory imposed by the senate and Tiberius on Piso after his suicide. The verdicts for his family members and accomplices are also included. The decree was posted on bronze in the major cities of the Empire and in the winter quarters of all the legions. The article argues for the following conclusions. The decree should be taken at face value and its punishments considered harsh for a member of the Roman office-holding élite. It was widely published throughout the Empire after there had been extravagant mourning for Germanicus. Consequently, it seems that post-mortem disgrace did not necessarily involve the family as a whole. Indeed, sanctions against memory appear to be consciously designed to preserve the Roman élite family, its assets, and social position by removing its erring member. Such sanctions reveal both a tension and an accommodation between remembering and forgetting, between the family and the community, between history and memory.","container-title":"Classical Antiquity","ISSN":"02786656","issue":"2","language":"EN","note":"00029","page":"155-187","title":"Rethinking \"Damnatio Memoriae\": The Case of Cn.

  {"id":"Lau2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Observers have expressed concern about growing inequality in resources across universities. But are universities really becoming more unequal? We argue that the typical approach of examining endowment growth alone is not sensible. In line with the literature on household inequality, we focus instead on a comprehensive income measure. We find that although there is considerable inequality among institutions, concerns about the inexorable growth of inequality are overblown. Whether one looks at income, endowment wealth, or expenditure, inequality has been high but stable, exhibiting only negligible increases in recent years. Furthermore, there has been little mobility within the higher education sector.","container-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","DOI":"10.3386/w21432","note":"00000","title":"Are Universities Becoming More Unequal?","URL":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w21432","volume":"No. 21432","author":[{"family":"Lau","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Rosen","given":"Harvey S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]}},

But the logic of outsourcing is a poor fit for some knowledge organization practices. When knowledge organization is understood as a process of exchange among peers, a sharing-oriented design strategy makes more sense. As an example of a sharing-oriented strategy for designing networked knowledge organization systems, we describe the design of the PeriodO period gazetteer.

[...] the College is beginning the necessary process of prioritizing its academic offerings.  According to faculty members, the news came after a morning meeting of the staff and a lunch.  Additionally, the college has seen sharp enrollment declines in its teacher training program, prompted by the lack of new teaching jobs across much of the state.  Countless local teachers received their training there, and the school has received gifts for new facilities from prominent area businesses, including the Hearst Foundation, an affiliate of Hearst Newspapers, which publishes the Times Union.

  {"id":"toth2002class","type":"article-journal","abstract":"With rapidly increasing enrollment and soaring tuition becoming major concerns of students, instructors, and administrators in many institutions of higher learning, the search to identify the most effective ways of delivering a high quality education at a reasonable cost continues. The decrease in government funding affecting many state-owned colleges and universities nationwide has often resulted in a decrease of course sections offered and an increase in the class size of the remaining available classes. The purpose of this review is to examine the current research regarding the relationship of class size to student achievement in higher education. The eight studies examined, published between 1990 and 2000, were analyzed as to methodological strength, measurement of achievement, significant findings, and resulting recommendations. The studies yielded mixed results, and upon close examination, it was found that the design methodologies were weak overall, with four of the eight studies examined defining ï¿½achievementï¿½ as simply the students' class grade alone. It is suggested that future research in this area investigate the possibility that other variables such as potential grade inflation, lower academic standards, student aptitude and readiness for college work, lack of remediation for ill-prepared and disadvantaged students, student learning styles, instructors' teaching styles, and student motivation and effort could confound research results in this area and may account for the inconsistent results.","container-title":"College Student Journal","issue":"2","page":"253","title":"Class size and achievement in higher education: A summary of current research","volume":"36","author":[{"family":"Toth","given":"Linda S"},{"family":"Montagna","given":"Linda G"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]}},

  {"id":"Geiser2015","type":"report","abstract":"This paper presents new and surprising findings on the relationship between race and SAT scores. The findings are based on the population of California residents who applied for admission to the University of California from 1994 through 2011, a sample of over 1.1 million students. The UC data show that socioeconomic background factors – family income, parental education, and race/ethnicity – account for a large and growing share of the variance in students’ SAT scores over the past twenty years. More than a third of the variance in SAT scores can now be predicted by factors known at students’ birth, up from a quarter of the variance in 1994. Of those factors, moreover, race has become the strongest predictor. Rather than declining in salience, race and ethnicity are now more important than either family income or parental education in accounting for test score differences. It must be cautioned that these findings are preliminary, and more research is needed to determine whether the California data reflect a broader national trend. But if these findings are representative, they have important implications for the ongoing debate over both affirmative action and standardized testing in college admissions.","collection-title":"Research and Occasional Papers Series","number":"10.15","publisher":"Center for studies in higher education","title":"The Growing correlation between race and sat scores: New findings from California","URL":"http://www.cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/growing-correlation-between-race-and-sat-scores-new-findings-california-saul-geiser","author":[{"family":"Geiser","given":"Saul"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10]]},"publisher-place":"Berkeley, CA"},

Thelin draws on both official institutional histories and the informal memories that constitute legends and lore to offer a fresh interpretation of an institutional past that reaches back to the colonial era and encompasses both well-known colleges and universities and such understudied institutions as community, women's, and historically black colleges, proprietary schools, and freestanding professional colleges. Thelin also addresses the role of local, state, and federal governments in colleges and universities, as well as the influence of private foundations and other organizations. And through imaginative interpretation of films, novels, and popular magazines, he illuminates the convoluted relationship between higher education and American culture. - Publisher.","ISBN":"0-8018-7855-1 978-0-8018-7855-8 0-8018-8004-1 978-0-8018-8004-9","language":"English","publisher":"Johns Hopkins University Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"A history of American higher education","author":[{"family":"Thelin","given":"John R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"publisher-place":"Baltimore"},

  {"id":"Kramer-Hajos2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This article offers an iconographic and stylistic analysis of the published painted larnakes (clay sarcophagi) with funerary scenes from Late Bronze Age Tanagra in central Greece. Previous scholarship has failed to account fully for the existence of a small number of depictions that appear to show unexpected gender roles: wailing men and officiating women. The latter offer us an example of women holding official positions in Mycenaean Greece and accord them an unexpected prominence in the burial ritual, which may suggest that they were responsible for the production of some of the larnax burials at Tanagra. The imagery on the larnakes thus provides a rare example of female agency in Mycenaean Greece.","container-title":"Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens","DOI":"10.2972/hesperia.84.4.0627","ISSN":"0018-098X","issue":"4","page":"627-667","source":"JSTOR","title":"Mourning on the Larnakes at Tanagra: Gender and Agency in Late Bronze Age Greece","title-short":"Mourning on the Larnakes at Tanagra","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2972/hesperia.84.4.0627","volume":"84","author":[{"family":"Kramer-Hajos","given":"Margaretha"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,17]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"container-title-short":"Hesp"},
  {"id":"Case2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper documents a marked increase in the all-cause mortality of middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women in the United States between 1999 and 2013. This change reversed decades of progress in mortality and was unique to the United States; no other rich country saw a similar turnaround. The midlife mortality reversal was confined to white non-Hispanics; black non-Hispanics and Hispanics at midlife, and those aged 65 and above in every racial and ethnic group, continued to see mortality rates fall. This increase for whites was largely accounted for by increasing death rates from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Although all education groups saw increases in mortality from suicide and poisonings, and an overall increase in external cause mortality, those with less education saw the most marked increases. Rising midlife mortality rates of white non-Hispanics were paralleled by increases in midlife morbidity. Self-reported declines in health, mental health, and ability to conduct activities of daily living, and increases in chronic pain and inability to work, as well as clinically measured deteriorations in liver function, all point to growing distress in this population. We comment on potential economic causes and consequences of this deterioration.","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1518393112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","page":"201518393","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Rising morbidity and mortality in midlife among white non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st century","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/10/29/1518393112","author":[{"family":"Case","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Deaton","given":"Angus"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,29]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,2]]},"PMID":"26575631","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

It sets religion in its full cultural context, between the primitive hamlet of the eighth century BC and the cosmopolitan, multicultural society of the first centuries of the Christian era. Volume 2 reveals the extraordinary diversity of ancient Roman religion. A comprehensive sourcebook, it presents a wide range of documents illustrating religious life in the Roman world - from the foundations of the city in the eighth century BC to the Christian capital more than a thousand years later. Each document is given a full introduction, explanatory notes and bibliography, and acts as a starting point for further discussion. Through paintings, sculptures, coins and inscriptions, as well as literary texts in translation, the book explores the major themes and problems of Roman religion, such as sacrifice, the religious calendar, divination, ritual, and priesthood. Starting from the archaeological traces of the earliest cults of the city, it finishes with a series of texts in which Roman authors themselves reflect on the nature of their own religion, its history, even its funny side. Judaism and Christianity are given full coverage, as important elements in the religious world of the Roman empire.","ISBN":"0-521-30401-6 978-0-521-30401-6 0-521-31682-0 978-0-521-31682-8 0-521-45015-2 978-0-521-45015-7 0-521-45646-0 978-0-521-45646-3","language":"English","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Religions of Rome","author":[{"family":"Beard","given":"Mary"},{"family":"North","given":"John"},{"family":"Price","given":"S.

  {"id":"Yang2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Objectives. We examined the variability in the percentage of students with personal belief exemptions (PBEs) from mandatory vaccinations in California schools and communities according to income, education, race, and school characteristics.Methods. We used spatial lag models to analyze 2007–2013 PBE data from the California Department of Public Health. The analyses included school- and regional-level models, and separately examined the percentage of students with exemptions in 2013 and the change in percentages over time.Results. The percentage of students with PBEs doubled from 2007 to 2013, from 1.54% to 3.06%. Across all models, higher median household income and higher percentage of White race in the population, but not educational attainment, significantly predicted higher percentages of students with PBEs in 2013. Higher income, White population, and private school type significantly predicted greater increases in exemptions from 2007 to 2013, whereas higher educational attainment was associated with smaller increases.Conclusions. Personal belief exemptions are more common in areas with a higher percentage of White race and higher income.","container-title":"American Journal of Public Health","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2015.302926","ISSN":"0090-0036","issue":"1","page":"172-177","source":"ajph.aphapublications.org (Atypon)","title":"Sociodemographic Predictors of Vaccination Exemptions on the Basis of Personal Belief in California","URL":"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302926","volume":"106","author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Y.

  {"id":"Fry2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The idea that academic libraries acquire a great many books that are never used, and that this is because traditional collection development – i.e., professional librarians purchasing books based on subject expertise and local knowledge of student and faculty needs and interests – is ineffective, has been repeated frequently during the last decade. This claim has been used as justification to change collection practices and to bolster ideas about new organizational models for libraries and their work. A closer look at the literature, however, reveals that the data being cited to support this claim has been communicated, for the most part, in an inaccurate and misleading way by its proponents and that a great deal of data exists, in fact, to refute it. This article outlines the genesis and propagation of this idea in the context of the actual findings of libraries’ collection use studies to both refute a claim that librarians seem to have been unduly uncritical in accepting and repeating, and also to question why we have done so.","container-title":"Library Philosophy and Practice","title":"Conventional Wisdom or Faulty Logic?

  {"id":"Carver1992","type":"book","abstract":"The age of Sutton Hoo runs from the fifth to the eighth century AD - the age which separates the fall of the Roman Empire from the emergence of the nation-states that have endured down to the present day. This is a dark and difficult age, where hard evidence is rare, but glittering and richly varied: 'myths, king-lists, placenames, sagas, settlements, runic inscriptions, palaces, belt-buckles, post-holes, middens and graves, ' says the editor, 'are all grist to our mill.'. This volume celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of that most famous burial of the early middle ages: the great treasure now in the British Museum, unearthed from the centre of a ninety-foot-long ship buried in the sand beneath a mound on remote Suffolk heathland at Sutton Hoo. It also marks the end of the major campaign of excavations carried out there over the past decade, which involved the widest possible range of disciplines. The scholars whose work is gathered here represent, together with Martin Carver's concluding chapter summarising the results of the latest excavations, the current state of knowledge about this extraordinary site; that it still has secrets to reveal is shown by the last-minute discovery of a striking burial of a young noble with his horse and grave goods.","ISBN":"0-585-22043-3 978-0-585-22043-7","language":"English","publisher":"Boydell Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The age of Sutton Hoo the seventh century in north-western Europe","URL":"http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=16567","author":[{"family":"Carver","given":"M.

Examination of the sample using techniques employed by forensic anthropology and entomology found that some of the material had been deposited in open waterlogged pits. The majority of the sample were adult males who had evidence for multiple peri-mortem blunt- and sharp- force injuries; many also had healed injuries, suggesting that violence was a common feature of their life. Despite the fact that this material was recovered from an industrial area in the upper Walbrook Valley of London, the evidence for trauma, their context and associated archaeological and environmental evidence reveals that these deposits are markedly different from other published examples of human remains from the Walbrook stream and River Thames, and may represent the remains of headhunting by the Roman army and/or defeated gladiators.","container-title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jas.2013.12.013","ISSN":"0305-4403","page":"214-226","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Headhunting and amphitheatre combat in Roman London, England: new evidence from the Walbrook Valley","title-short":"Headhunting and amphitheatre combat in Roman London, England","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440313004433","volume":"43","author":[{"family":"Redfern","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Bonney","given":"Heather"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,3]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3]]},"container-title-short":"JAS"},

These professionals are, in a sense, trace elements that allow us to track transformation in attitudes towards the body and the power of touch to heal from the high Empire into Late Antiquity.

  {"id":"Alexander2012","type":"chapter","abstract":"This chapter examines the liberal arts sector, small colleges, and universities focused on traditional-age undergraduate education, ones that have apparently played little role in the digital humanities movement. It considers the sector’s relative silence, as it identifies a series of reasonable objections to the engagement of liberal arts colleges in the digital humanities. It summarizes these objections and then identifies responses. This call-and-response framing is used in order to take criticism seriously, while fully delineating the liberal arts sector’s achievements. The mismatch between critique and liberal arts practice uncovered by this framing is revealing. Ultimately, those achievements have come to constitute a different mode for the digital humanities, a separate path worth identifying, understanding, and encouraging, one based on emphasizing a distributed, socially engaged process over a focus on publicly shared products.","call-number":"AZ182 .D44 2012","container-title":"Debates in the digital humanities","ISBN":"978-0-8166-7794-8 978-0-8166-7795-5","page":"85-95","publisher":"Univ Of Minnesota Press","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Should Liberal Arts Campuses Do Digital Humanities?

  {"id":"Nia2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The fact that acoustic radiation from a violin at air-cavity resonance is monopolar and can be determined by pure volume change is used to help explain related aspects of violin design evolution. By determining the acoustic conductance of arbitrarily shaped sound holes, it is found that air flow at the perimeter rather than the broader sound-hole area dominates acoustic conductance, and coupling between compressible air within the violin and its elastic structure lowers the Helmholtz resonance frequency from that found for a corresponding rigid instrument by roughly a semitone. As a result of the former, it is found that as sound-hole geometry of the violin's ancestors slowly evolved over centuries from simple circles to complex f-holes, the ratio of inefficient, acoustically inactive to total sound-hole area was decimated, roughly doubling air-resonance power efficiency. F-hole length then slowly increased by roughly 30% across two centuries in the renowned workshops of Amati, Stradivari and Guarneri, favouring instruments with higher air-resonance power, through a corresponding power increase of roughly 60%. By evolution-rate analysis, these changes are found to be consistent with mutations arising within the range of accidental replication fluctuations from craftsmanship limitations with subsequent selection favouring instruments with higher air-resonance power.","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspa.2014.0905","ISSN":"1364-5021, 1471-2946","issue":"2175","language":"en","page":"20140905-20140905","source":"rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org","title":"The evolution of air resonance power efficiency in the violin and its ancestors","URL":"http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/471/2175/20140905","volume":"471","author":[{"family":"Nia","given":"Hadi T."},{"family":"Jain","given":"Ankita D."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yuming"},{"family":"Alam","given":"Mohammad-Reza"},{"family":"Barnas","given":"Roman"},{"family":"Makris","given":"Nicholas C."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,20]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,8]]},"container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"Letta2013","type":"article-journal","abstract":"A re-examination of all the sources allows the author to conclude what follows: 1) Fest., p. 487 L., s.v. Tuscum vicum (of whose text a new reconstruction is proposed), and Claudius' discourse in the Tabula Lugdunensis present the same Etruscan tradition on Caeles Vibenna's arrival in Rome in the service of Tarquinius Priscus. Tacitus' digression on Mount Caelius (ann., IV, 65), whose source is very likely another Claudian discourse, demonstrates that in Claudius' opinion the occupation of the Mount Caelius by the Caeliani was not a hostile conquest. Therefore in the Lyons tablet occupavit means that they took legitimately possession of the Mount Caelius, placed at their disposal by Tarquinius Priscus, as the cives took legitimately possession of the ager occupatorius. 2) Arnob., adv. nat., VI, 7 does not demonstrate that Mastarna-Servius Tullius killed Aulus Vibenna after Caeles' death. 3) The 'historical' scene of the Tomba François does not represent the slaughter of Tarquinius Priscus and the conquest of Rome by the Vibennae; on the contrary, it represents an episode of the struggle for the power at Rome, caused by an unsuccessful attempt to usurp the throne carried out after Tarquinius Priscus' death by another Tarquinius (Cneve Tarchunies). 4) Mastarna-macstrna (nickname of Servius Tullius) is an Etruscan adjective derived from the Latin magister, perhaps of the same type as some Latin adjectives derived from names of magisterial or sacerdotal offices (praetorius, censorius etc.), which often became nicknames or cognomina (Censorius / Censorinus, Augurinus, Flamininus etc.).","container-title":"Studi Classici e Orientali","ISSN":"0081-6124","page":"91-115","source":"JSTOR","title":"Dalla \"Tabula Lugdunensis\" alla Tomba François: la tradizione etrusca su Servio Tullio","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24189486","volume":"59","author":[{"family":"Letta","given":"Cesare"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]}},

  {"id":"MacMullen2011","type":"book","abstract":"\"A vibrant account that puts flesh on the bare bones of early Roman history.\"--Celia Schultz, University of Michigan The ancient Romans' story down to 264 B.C. can be made credible by stripping away their later myths and inventions to show how their national character shaped their destiny. After many generations of scholarly study, consensus is clear: the account in writers like Livy is not to be trusted because their aims were different from ours in history-writing. They wanted their work to be both improving and diverting. It should grow out of the real past, yes, but if that reality couldn't be recovered, or was uncertain, their art did not forbid invention. It more than tolerated dramatic incidents, passions, heroes, heroines, and villains. If, however, all this resulting ancient fiction and adornment are pruned away, a national character can be seen in the remaining bits and pieces of credible information, to explain the familiar story at least in its outlines. To doubt the written sources has long been acceptable, but this or that detail or narrative section must always be left for salvage by special pleading. To press home the logic of doubt is new. To reach beyond the written sources for a better support in excavated evidence is no novelty; but it is a novelty, to find in archeology the principal substance of the narrative--which is the choice in this book. To use this in turn for the discovery of an ethnic personality, a Roman national character, is key and also novel. What is repeatedly illustrated and emphasized here is the distance traveled by the art or craft of understanding the past--\"history\" in that sense--over the course of the last couple of centuries. The art cannot be learned, because it cannot be found, through studying Livy and Company. Readers who care about either of the two disciplines contrasted, Classics and History, may find this argument of interest. \"Like Thucydides of the hyperactive Athenians and de Tocqueville of the nation-building Americans, MacMullen here draws a character sketch of the early Romans--the men who built Rome, conquered Italy, and created an empire. Based on profound familiarity with history, evidence, and their better-known descendants, attention to what they did and failed to do, remarkable insight, empathy, constructive imagination, and not without humor, he reconstructs the homo Romanus and thus helps us imagine what he was like, and understand why he achieved what he did. This little book is informative, full of important ideas, and delightful to read.\"--Kurt Raaflaub, Brown University Jacket image: Marcus Fabius and Quintus Tannius. Fresco.

  {"id":"Turfa1996","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Se esaminati da un punto di vista ingegneristico, gli edifíci monumentali greci presentano sostanziali differenze con quelli di origini etrusco/italica. La tecnica greca comprendeva l'uso di imponenti architravi in pietra atti a resistere al carico imposto lateralmente dai pesanti tetti in tegole di terracotta. Gli Etruschi risolsero lo stesso problema grazie all'uso di travi su cui veniva scaricata la tensione. L'uso di travi di tensione in Italia rese possible la copertura a tetto di strutture con campate molto ampie (senza colonne interne) e con ampi aggetti, stabilendo così la caratteristica confìgurazione del tempio toscano. Calcoli basati sulle misure dei tempi greci ed etrusco/italici hanno evidenziato come la trave di tensione toscana fosse più effìciente rispetto alle tecniche greche dell'epoca. Gli architetti greci, in virtù dell'abbondanza di utile materiale da costruzione e di lavoro stagionale, non erano forse stimolati allo sviluppo di nuove tecniche, o forse non riuscirono mai a risolvere il problema delle giunture di tensione. In contrasto con i metodi moderni, che fanno uso intensivo del metallo, gli antichi ingegneri etruschi erano costretti ad usare giunture di collegamento in legno nelle strutture di legno del tetto, al fine di porre una resistenza al carico laterale dei tetti in tegole. Questa pratica potrebbe già essere stata introdotta nell'VII secolo a. C, quando le tegole di terracotta furono introdotte nelle città etrusche. Tale tecnica è attestata dalle campate di grandi edifici quali l'edifìcio sudest di Murlo (c. 630-600 a. C.), il tempio Portonaccio a Veii ed il tempio A di Pyrgi, e viene data per scontata per il Capitolium a Roma (dedicato nel 509 a. C.). Le travi di tensione continuarono ad essere usate per vari secoli, rendendo possibile la costruzione delle basiliche romane della media e tarda repubblica, nonché i tipi successivi.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","ISSN":"0068-2462","note":"00000","page":"1-39","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Comparative Structure of Greek and Etruscan Monumental Buildings","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40310930","volume":"64","author":[{"family":"Turfa","given":"Jean MacIntosh"},{"family":"Steinmayer","given":"Alwin G."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,26]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1996]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},

  {"id":"Altonji2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper uses administrative student and expenditure data from Florida public universities to describe a) how the cost of producing graduates varies by major, b) how the inclusion of major-specific instructional costs alters the estimated net returns to different fields of study, and c) how major-specific instructional expenditures changed between 1999 and 2013. We find that the cost of producing graduates in the highest cost major (engineering) is roughly double that of producing graduates in low-cost majors, such as business. Cross-major comparisons of per graduate earnings returns net of costs differ from comparisons based on earnings outcomes alone in economically significant ways for a number of fields. Differences between net returns and earnings returns per dollar of instructional spending are even more pronounced.  Our analysis of trends in instructional expenditures shows that per credit expenditures for undergraduate classes dropped by 16% in Florida universities between 1999 and 2013. The largest drops occurred in engineering and health, where per credit spending fell by more than 40%. Observed spending changes have little relationship with per credit costs or earnings outcomes.","container-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series","DOI":"10.3386/w23029","issue":"published as Joseph G.

  {"id":"Bell2002","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper is based on field survey work carried out in the Sangro Valley, Abruzzo, Italy, between 1994 and 1998. While the preliminary results of the survey are published elsewhere (Lloyd et al. 1997), this article presents the results of a computer-based GIS methodology for reconstructing routes of communication between ancient sites in a landscape, designed to complement traditional survey methodologies and explore the so-called off-site archaeology that exists between areas of intense antique occupation within the landscape. In doing so this research not only demonstrates the theoretical value of such an approach, but also shows how its practical application has helped the project understand in greater detail the ancient landscape of the Sangro river valley. The principal results of this analysis applied to settlement patterns in the middle Sangro Valley were to show that the fortified hilltop center of Monte Pallano was closely integrated into the communications network of the surrounding settlements, that one of the largest Samnite and Roman settlements discovered by the survey lay on a junction of several well-frequented routes, and that a large area of off-site material probably derives from Iron Age cemeteries overlooking a heavily used route around the southern flank of Monte Pallano.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.2307/4126242","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"2","note":"00000","page":"169-186","source":"JSTOR","title":"Tracking the Samnites: Landscape and Communications Routes in the Sangro Valley, Italy","title-short":"Tracking the Samnites","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4126242","volume":"106","author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Wickham","given":"Andrew"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,15]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,4]]}},

It must be admitted that not all the new texts are being published very well; and that some are appearing only in sketchy or popular accounts and in newspapers or journals which are either irrelevant to Classical studies, or are mushrooms which die after a few numbers and so do not find their way into most Classical libraries. This is tedious, but better, surely, than that they should remain quite unreported. In any case, although the writer's own record in this matter is blacker than it should be, it seems reasonable to urge again that excavators and epigraphists should be more willing to give quickly an initial publication which does not aim to be definitive on the first round.","container-title":"Journal of Roman Studies","DOI":"10.2307/300013","ISSN":"0075-4358, 1753-528X","language":"en","note":"00000","page":"136-152","source":"CrossRef","title":"Roman Inscriptions 1966–1970","URL":"http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S007543580006706X","volume":"61","author":[{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Joyce"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,29]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1971,11]]},"container-title-short":"JRS"},

The temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, the first major temple built in the early city, and the destination of Roman triumphs, had been a casualty in the Civil War of AD 68-69, and was rebuilt to highlight his interest in tradition, and to place the Capitolium at the centre of his political programme. The spoils from the Jewish War made possible a great deal of public building elsewhere in the city, including the Forum of Peace and the Colosseum; these buildings reinforced the message about the military success of the Flavians and the benefits they were bringing to the populace.","container-title":"Acta Classica","ISSN":"0065-1141","note":"00000","page":"165-180","source":"JSTOR","title":"Vespasian and the city of Rome: The centrality of the capitolium","title-short":"VESPASIAN AND THE CITY OF ROME","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24592508","volume":"53","author":[{"family":"Lindsay","given":"Hugh"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,31]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"container-title-short":"AClass"},

Indeed. by divorcing the korai very firmly from their physical contexts and. by extension. from any accompanying rituaL Stieber can allow herself to discuss Phrasikleia and the Acropolis statues as though they were categorically the same. The physical world of the Archaic Acropolis or the Archaic countryside is invisible throughout the book. Yet neither the Acropolis korai nor the funerary korai stood in a blank space; they existed as part of a visual landscape at times full of other statues. inscriptions and monumental architecture. To ignore this backdrop and replace it with a contextualization which privileges textual sources. many of which are later in date. detracts from a detailed and interesting study. Despite some flaws. students of sculpture and literature will find much that is useful in The Poetics of Appearance. The book is ideal for advanced undergraduate seminars on Archaic art in which students could read and discuss Stieber~s interpretations alongside Kees1ing~s. In Votive Statues. Keesling interprets the korai within the context of Acropolis dedications and argues that the statues represent Athena. Stieber's strength is her willingness to depart from the traditional approach of Richter and others, and to probe more deeply into the minutiae of details which comprise the physical make-up of the korai. Nonetheless . Stieber's alternative reading would have been more convincing if she had grounded it in some of the most basic issues of function and context.

A cautionary note must be sounded at the outset. In his first chapter. and several times in the ensuing text. the author states as fact the un- 37° BOOK REVIEWS/COMPTES RENDUS proven hypothesis that the same Greek bronze statue was commonly replicated in serial production. There can be little doubt that his first examples, the 62 em high twin statuettes of boys in Eastern costume with pyramidal hat in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore, found together in Egypt in 1912 (6-7, figs. 3-4), were made as a matching pair in the late Hellenistic or early Imperial period. But that they were simply made in the indirect method of casting bronze as \"a series of the same statue ... from the same original working model\" (7) is purely hypothetical if not simply impossible. These statuettes have highly complicated surfaces with a considerable amount of undercutting which required multiple piece molds, and it seems likely that parts of them were made by direct casting methods, in which the original wax model would be lost in the casting process. Skillful craftsmen with good eye and hand co-ordination satisfied the need for the duplication required in this unusual case for reasons that were either iconographical or, per aps more likely, functional , as the figures may well have been lamp or incense bearers.I Such practical bronze figures, often in pairs, were produced for Roman use as early as 100 B.C.2 Hemingway's second example (7 n. I r), two late Hellenistic or early Roman bronze statuettes of Pan in a private collection in New York, probably decorative parts of an item of furniture, perhaps a tripod, are clearly described in the source Hemingway himself cites as \"not cast at the same time, after the same original modeL\" but, rather, \"one statuette was most likely modeled in direct and intentional imitation of the other, at a slightly later time in antiquity.\"3 As the French scholar Claude Rolley has repeatedly stated, there were only exceptional reasons for duplicating statues in the Greek period (e.g...","container-title":"Mouseion: Journal of the Classical Association of Canada","DOI":"10.1353/mou.2004.0041","ISSN":"1913-5416","issue":"3","note":"00000","page":"369-374","source":"Project MUSE","title":"The Horse and Jockey from Artemision: A Bronze Equestrian Monument of the Hellenistic Period by Seán Hemingway","title-short":"The Horse and Jockey from Artemision","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/591335/summary","volume":"4","author":[{"family":"Barr-Sharrar","given":"Beryl"}],"reviewed-author":[{"family":"Hemingway","given":"Séan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,4]]}},

  {"id":"Jamison1999","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In India it is a commonplace that the great epic, the Mahābhārata, is a dharma or legal text. It can also be demonstrated not only that there are explicit references to ritual in the epic narrative, but that the narrative sometimes covertly encodes ritual, allowing the audience to experience the narrative on several levels at once. I will suggest that it is possible to read the Odyssey both as a legal and a ritual text and that explicit reference to the rich legal, ritual, and epic materials of ancient India clarifies much that is murky in the Odyssey, given the Indo-European heritage that they both share. The paper focuses on three issues: (1) A legal point: the legal status of Penelope, particularly with regard to her remarriage. Should she remarry, and if so, who has the authority to arrange such a marriage? Both legal and epic materials in Sanskrit treat in detail the situation of a woman whose husband has gone abroad and disappeared. (2) A legal institution: the marital self-choice (svayamvara in Sanskrit) and its relevance to Penelope and the suitors. The self-choice is a common type of marriage for kings' daughters in Sanskrit, in which the princess \"chooses\" a husband from a group of assembled suitors. Often the \"choice\" is governed by an act of strength and skill, just as Penelope's marriage contest was. (3) A ritual: the consecration of the king (Rājasūya in Sanskrit) and its relevance to Odysseus' return. Odysseus' return to Ithaka can be read as a covert encoding of a royal consecration ritual similar to the Sanskrit Rājasūya. In particular, the theme of the bow, the importance accorded to Eumaios' pigs, and the narrative of the boar hunt all find their counterparts in the Sanskrit ritual.","container-title":"Classical Antiquity","DOI":"10.2307/25011102","ISSN":"0278-6656","issue":"2","page":"227-272","source":"JSTOR","title":"Penelope and the Pigs: Indic Perspectives on the \"Odyssey\"","title-short":"Penelope and the Pigs","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25011102","volume":"18","author":[{"family":"Jamison","given":"Stephanie W."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]}},

Well-known examples occur across Russia in the gilded minarets and onion domes associ­ated with the orthodox churches and government building, such as those in Moscow and St. Peters. In the United States, one of the oldest gilded exterior structures is the Bullfinch dome and lantern atop the Massachusetts State House. Dating from the late 18th century, this copper dome is due to be re-gilded as part of the general restoration of the State House Complex.

  {"id":"Frischer2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The article takes as its point of departure recent work (Frischer forthcoming) critiquing the theory of Edmund Buchner about the relationship of the gnomonical instrument known as the Horologium Augusti and the Ara Pacis Augustae. As a result of this critique, the Montecitorio Obelisk could be situated with greater precision on the map of the city. A computer simulation showed that Buchner erred in positing that the shadow of the Montecitorio Obelisk went into the center of the Ara Pacis on Augustus’ birthday. In this article, computer simulations are used to develop a post-Buchnerian interpretation of the relationship of the obelisk and altar. Over 230 hitherto unrecognized solar and shadow alignments are reported.  The first part of the article defines four zones around the monuments where the solar and shadows observations were made. In the second part of the article, specialists interpret the significance of the annual solar and shadow spectacle from various points of view. The conclusion synthesizes the results, arguing that the monuments were intentionally aligned and situated in order to propagate the same message as the one inscribed on two sides of the Montecitorio Obelisk [CIL 6.702 = ILS 91]: that Augustus was a devoted worshipper of the sun god (Sol), who brings Rome victory in war, peace, and prosperity through his earthly representative, the emperor.","container-title":"Studies in Digital Heritage","issue":"1","language":"en","source":"scholarworks.iu.edu","title":"New light on the relationship between the Montecitorio obelisk and Ara Pacis of Augustus","URL":"https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/sdh/article/view/23331","volume":"1","author":[{"family":"Frischer","given":"Bernard"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,17]]}},

Attraverso il riesame dei dati archeologici disponibili ed una rilettura delle fonti antiche hanno trovato conferma alcune ipotesi e sono state formulate nuove proposte di identificazione. In particolare sia l’Auguraculum, che il tempio di Iuno Moneta debbono essere collocati in summa Arce, ovvero nell’angolo Nord-Est del colle al di sotto del monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II. Ad un livello inferiore sul versante meridionale va posto invece il santuario di Iside Capitolina, i cui resti vennero messi in luce nell’area dell’Oratorio francescano di S. Maria in Aracoeli. In questo ambito topografico dell’Arx possono trovare ubicazione anche due importanti santuari legati alla dinastia flavia e alle vicende storiche dell’incendio del Campidoglio del 69 d. C.: il sacellum di Iuppiter Conservator e il tempio di Iuppiter Custos, i cui resti sono stati riconosciuti rispettivamente all’interno del Palazzo Nuovo del Museo Capitolino e nelle due notevoli fondazioni in conglomerato cementizio visibili nel Giardino dell’Aracoeli.","container-title":"Mélanges de l'École française de Rome - Antiquité","DOI":"10.4000/mefra.338","ISSN":"0223-5102","issue":"122-1","language":"it","page":"117-146","source":"mefra.revues.org","title":"Osservazioni sulla topografia sacra dell’Arx capitolina","URL":"https://mefra.revues.org/338?lang=es","author":[{"family":"Arata","given":"Francesco Paolo"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,28]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,15]]},"container-title-short":"MEFRA"},

  {"id":"Krewinkel2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The timely publication of scientific results is essential for dynamic advances in science. The ubiquitous availability of computers which are connected to a global network made the rapid and low-cost distribution of information through electronic channels possible. New concepts, such as Open Access publishing and preprint servers are currently changing the traditional print media business towards a community-driven peer production. However, the cost of scientific literature generation, which is either charged to readers, authors or sponsors, is still high. The main active participants in the authoring and evaluation of scientific manuscripts are volunteers, and the cost for online publishing infrastructure is close to negligible. A major time and cost factor is the formatting of manuscripts in the production stage. In this article we demonstrate the feasibility of writing scientific manuscripts in plain markdown (MD) text files, which can be easily converted into common publication formats, such as PDF, HTML or EPUB, using Pandoc. The simple syntax of Markdown assures the long-term readability of raw files and the development of software and workflows. We show the implementation of typical elements of scientific manuscripts—formulas, tables, code blocks and citations—and present tools for editing, collaborative writing and version control. We give an example on how to prepare a manuscript with distinct output formats, a DOCX file for submission to a journal, and a LATEX/PDF version for deposition as a PeerJ preprint. Further, we implemented new features for supporting ‘semantic web’ applications, such as the ‘journal article tag suite’—JATS, and the ‘citation typing ontology’—CiTO standard. Reducing the work spent on manuscript formatting translates directly to time and cost savings for writers, publishers, readers and sponsors. Therefore, the adoption of the MD format contributes to the agile production of open science literature.

  {"id":"Bartolini2016","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The Basilica of San Miniato al Monte is one of the oldest churches in Florence: its construction began in 1018 by the Bishop Hildebrand who wanted to celebrate St. Minias, the patron Saint of the city. The Basilica is one of the finest examples of Romanesque in Tuscany and presents intriguing astronomical and symbolic allusions that, however, largely remain undiscovered. This article presents the study on the relationship between architecture, religious symbols and astronomical elements of the church of San Miniato al Monte. In order to identify possible correlations between the position of the Sun and the decorative components of the Basilica that are illuminated by sunlight, we adopted the GNSS methodology and a Total Station. We found that the figures of Christ and the Virgin Mary on the apse mosaic are illuminated by the Sun during the Easter period, and the crypt altar, containing the relics of Saint Minias, is brightened on the day of his martyrdom. The preeminent symbolic/astronomical element is certainly the marble zodiac, similar to that of the Baptistery, which Capricorn-Cancer axis coincides with the axis of the Basilica. At the summer solstice a fascinating light phenomenon occurs: the sunlight perfectly illuminates the Cancer sign, thereby confirming the astronomical function of the marble zodiac. Furthermore the sunbeams coming from the windows of the right wall of the nave design a path of light on the ideal axis of the Basilica. The re-discovered astronomical role of this zodiac led us to hypothesize that the marble zodiac of the Baptistery of Florence was originally placed adjacent to the basement of the columns in front of the northern door of the Baptistery. In this way, on summer solstice day the light beam coming from the central opening of the dome, would have illuminated the Cancer sign, similarly to what happens for the zodiac of San Miniato.","container-title":"Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.220972","issue":"4","language":"EN","page":"473-480","source":"DataCite","title":"Astronomy And Solar Symbology In The Basilica Of San Miniato Al Monte And In The Baptistery Of San Giovanni In Florence","volume":"16","author":[{"family":"Bartolini","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Pierozzi","given":"Marco"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,23]]}},

In the first instance, Greek confidence in the superiority of Hellenic culture made explanations for the swiftness of Roman conquest all the more necessary. In accounting for Rome's success, Greeks focused on the structure and character of the Roman state, on Roman attitudes towards citizenship, and on the nature of the Roman constitution. Greeks initially attempted to understand Roman institutions and beliefs by assimilating them to paradigms within Hellenistic political thought. On the one hand, this process tended to obscure substantial differences between Greek and Roman political theory. At the same time, appreciation of Rome's relations with Italy created a means through which Greeks could imagine their own integration into the Roman community. Among the conceptual models available to Greeks of this age, only the polis provided a paradigm for a collectivity in which individuals had equal rights and toward which they directed their patriotic sentiments. That Roman Italy was not a polis did not force the coinage of new terminology: the polis formed a conceptual boundary that Hellenistic political philosophy never truly escaped. Repeated construals of Roman ideas and institutions on analogy with polis-based models ultimately forced a shift in the semantic fields of Greek political terminology and altered Greeks' conceptual archetype of the political collectivity. This process provided a framework within which Greeks could justify their wholesale participation in imperial culture and political life: they could, on these terms, argue that the gradual evolution of the world toward a single, unified empire actualized man's natural tendency to center his life around a single polis.","container-title":"Classical Antiquity","DOI":"10.2307/25011091","ISSN":"0278-6656","issue":"1","page":"5-34","source":"JSTOR","title":"Was Rome a Polis?","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25011091","volume":"18","author":[{"family":"Ando","given":"Clifford"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"container-title-short":"CA"},

À l'évidence pourtant son histoire est en étroit rapport avec le processus de refonte et de réorganisation de la société romaine qui s'accomplit dans les années 450-400. Qu'ils alternent avec les consuls durant une partie de cette période ne doit pas nous détourner de reconnaître dans cette évolution l'œuvre des tribuns consulaires. Car pendant les années d'alternance les mêmes noms se retrouvent dans les Fastes de ces deux magistratures. Lorsque d'autre part, dans la deuxième(v. au verso) partie de son histoire, le tribunat consulaire devint accessible à la plèbe, la voie se trouva ouverte à la constitution du premier noyau d'une noblesse plébéienne.","container-title":"Mélanges de l'Ecole française de Rome.

  {"id":"Holloway2008","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Cet article se penche sur les collèges de Tribuni Militum Consulari Potestate, qui, dans les histoires des débuts de la République romaine ayant survécu, auraient largement remplacé le consulat pendant la période de 444 à 367 av. J.-C. Ces collèges sont une invention des annalistes romains. Les membres de ces collèges étaient les meneurs de troupes guerrières privées, honorés du titre de tribuni militum, auxquels leur commandement – ainsi ont raisonné les annalistes – donnaient des pouvoirs consulaires. Dans la démonstration, on examine le problème des Annales Maximi pontificales qui, ainsi que Caton l’Ancien le montre, n’avaient aucune valeur comme source de l’histoire politique ou militaire. On peut également conclure que les Romains déduisaient les dates des débuts de la République de synchronismes avec des événements du monde grec.","container-title":"L'antiquité classique","DOI":"10.3406/antiq.2008.3716","issue":"1","language":"eng","page":"107-125","source":"www.persee.fr","title":"Who Were the <i>Tribuni Militum Consulari Potestate</i>?","URL":"http://www.persee.fr/doc/antiq_0770-2817_2008_num_77_1_3716","volume":"77","author":[{"family":"Holloway","given":"R.

  {"id":"Flower2000","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper aims to reexamine how traditions about the spolia opima developed with special emphasis on two crucial phases of their evolution, the time of Marcus Claudius Marcellus' dedication in 222 BC and the early years of Augustus' principate, following the restoration of the temple of Jupiter Feretrius on the Capitol. In particular, I will argue that Marcellus invented the spolia opima, that his feat shaped the entire tradition about such dedications, and that this tradition was later enhanced and \"reinvented\" by Augustus, probably following upon renewed interest under Julius Caesar. Through an evaluation of the surviving evidence about the three canonical dedicators (Romulus, A. Cornelius Cossus, and Marcellus) the possibility is explored that the spolia opima, rather than being an archaic ritual dating back to the regal period, represent a tradition invented (and reinvented) by specific individuals at certain well-defined moments in Roman history. Augustus himself, beginning while he was still a child, was influenced by traditions about the career and achievements of M. Claudius Marcellus. Augustus' interest in Marcellus helps to explain his special focus on the spolia opima as a significant and hallowed Roman tradition. Consequently, in the late first century B.C., spolia opima were associated both with old-fashioned \"republican\" aspirations and also with the iconography and self-definition of the new ruling family. In this context other leading Romans of the age considered dedicating such spolia, notably M. Licinius Crassus, grandson of the triumvir, and the elder Drusus, brother of Tiberius. In addition, Virgil included the spolia opima as a recurring theme in the second half of the Aeneid. The poem reaches its climax when Aeneas kills his rival Italian leader Turnus in a duel which would have entitled him to dedicate spolia opima.","container-title":"Classical Antiquity","DOI":"10.2307/25011111","ISSN":"0278-6656","issue":"1","page":"34-64","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Tradition of the Spolia Opima: M.

  {"id":"McDonald2014","type":"thesis","abstract":"This thesis examines evidence for language contact between Oscan and Greek in the corpus of Oscan inscriptions from Lucania, Bruttium and Messana. These inscriptions were written in an adapted form of the Greek alphabet from around the fourth to first century BC, with a few of the latest texts written in the Latin alphabet; as a group, these texts are referred to as ‘South Oscan’. The work draws on modern sociolinguistic theory of bilingualism and language contact alongside previous scholarship on ancient linguistics, epigraphy and archaeology. It also suggests a series of general principles for dealing with small epigraphic corpora from a sociolinguistic viewpoint. \n \nAfter laying out these frameworks, this work gives an introduction to the sites of the region and past scholarship on language contact in this corpus. The main body of the thesis deals with the corpus of texts from a number of complementary angles. Firstly, the adaptation of the South Oscan alphabet from the Greek alphabet is explored in detail. In particular, the development of various signs for /f/ and the use of ‘extra’ Greek characters like chi, theta and phi are investigated as evidence of ongoing contact between the languages. \n \nThe rest of the thesis deals with the corpus by genre or inscription type: this includes dedications, curse tablets, legal texts, official texts (including coin legends) and funerary texts. While some types of text, such as curse tablets, show pronounced influence and borrowing from Greek, other genres such as legal or official texts show far fewer contact phenomena, even within the same community. In other instances, language contact appears to have resulted in regional linguistic developments: for example, some of the formulae used in South Oscan dedicatory and funerary texts appear to be creative adaptations arising from a combination of influences from both Oscan and Greek, without fully adopting existing models from either language. This thesis therefore stresses that communities developed norms about the appropriateness of borrowing from Greek in various kinds of texts. In many instances, linguistic and epigraphic borrowing from Greek in written texts seems to be determined by individual choice and variation within these community norms, rather than the result of incompetence.","genre":"Thesis","language":"en","publisher":"University of Cambridge","source":"www.repository.cam.ac.uk","title":"Language contact in South Oscan epigraphy","URL":"https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/245201","author":[{"family":"McDonald","given":"Katherine Louise"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,17]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,4]]}},

Secondo alcuni Autori del XVIII e del XIX secolo, il Tempietto sarebbe stato in origine un sacello “pagano”, successivamente trasformato in edificio di culto cristiano; secondo altri, invece, sarebbe stato edificato, fin dalle fondamenta, in età paleocristiana; a giudizio di altri ancora, esso risalirebbe all’Alto Medioevo e sarebbe un’importante testimonianza architettonica dei Longobardi del ducato di Spoleto.\nDating the Tempietto sul Clitunno is still a subject of controversy, although so many studies have been made during the last two centuries and above all in the last few years. Some authors in 18th and 19th centuries thought the Tempietto was a “pagan” sacellum from the beginning and only successively transformed to serve christian functions; other authors, on the contrary, are of the opinion that the foundations of the building were laid in the early christian age; some other authors date it to the early medieval age and think it represents an important monument belonging to the longobard architecture of the Duchy of Spoleto.","container-title":"Lanx","page":"1-47","title":"Considerazioni sulla cronologia del Tempietto sul Clitumno","volume":"18","author":[{"family":"Binazzi","given":"Gianfranco"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]}},

  {"id":"Richardson1980","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The temple of Saturn, though its ruins on the Forum Romanum are impressive, presents many problems in architecture and planning. It fronted on an important square, the Area Volcani, where there were a number of sacred monuments and where four important streets and a stair to the Capitoline converged. But the principal visual relation of the temple was originally to the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline hill above it. The problem of the form and location of the old Aerarium cannot be completely resolved without more evidence than is available, but the reconstruction of the approach to the temple as rebuilt by Munatius Plancus offered by Lugli and now widely accepted must be discarded. It depends in large part on a misreading of a lost fragment of the Marble Plan; this is shown to have been erroneously assigned to this part of the Forum and may belong to the temple of Venus Verticordia near the Circus Maximus. The evidence for Lugli's Aerarium has also been misinterpreted by him. Livy records the building of a porticus in 174 B. C. that ran from the temple of Saturn in Capitolium to a senaculum and curia. It is argued here that this could not have run up along the Clivus Capitolinus but must have run across the northwest end of the Forum to the Curia Hostilia and made a dramatic backdrop to the Forum.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.2307/504394","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"1","page":"51-62","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Approach to the Temple of Saturn in Rome","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/504394","volume":"84","author":[{"family":"Richardson","given":"Lawrence"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,20]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1980]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

  {"id":"Dehghan2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"<h2>Summary</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>The relationship between macronutrients and cardiovascular disease and mortality is controversial. Most available data are from European and North American populations where nutrition excess is more likely, so their applicability to other populations is unclear.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study is a large, epidemiological cohort study of individuals aged 35–70 years (enrolled between Jan 1, 2003, and March 31, 2013) in 18 countries with a median follow-up of 7·4 years (IQR 5·3–9·3). Dietary intake of 135 335 individuals was recorded using validated food frequency questionnaires. The primary outcomes were total mortality and major cardiovascular events (fatal cardiovascular disease, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure). Secondary outcomes were all myocardial infarctions, stroke, cardiovascular disease mortality, and non-cardiovascular disease mortality. Participants were categorised into quintiles of nutrient intake (carbohydrate, fats, and protein) based on percentage of energy provided by nutrients. We assessed the associations between consumption of carbohydrate, total fat, and each type of fat with cardiovascular disease and total mortality. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) using a multivariable Cox frailty model with random intercepts to account for centre clustering.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>During follow-up, we documented 5796 deaths and 4784 major cardiovascular disease events. Higher carbohydrate intake was associated with an increased risk of total mortality (highest [quintile 5] <i>vs</i> lowest quintile [quintile 1] category, HR 1·28 [95% CI 1·12–1·46], p<sub>trend</sub>=0·0001) but not with the risk of cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease mortality. Intake of total fat and each type of fat was associated with lower risk of total mortality (quintile 5 <i>vs</i> quintile 1, total fat: HR 0·77 [95% CI 0·67–0·87], p<sub>trend</sub><0·0001; saturated fat, HR 0·86 [0·76–0·99], p<sub>trend</sub>=0·0088; monounsaturated fat: HR 0·81 [0·71–0·92], p<sub>trend</sub><0·0001; and polyunsaturated fat: HR 0·80 [0·71–0·89], p<sub>trend</sub><0·0001). Higher saturated fat intake was associated with lower risk of stroke (quintile 5 <i>vs</i> quintile 1, HR 0·79 [95% CI 0·64–0·98], p<sub>trend</sub>=0·0498). Total fat and saturated and unsaturated fats were not significantly associated with risk of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular disease mortality.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>High carbohydrate intake was associated with higher risk of total mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to lower total mortality. Total fat and types of fat were not associated with cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease mortality, whereas saturated fat had an inverse association with stroke. Global dietary guidelines should be reconsidered in light of these findings.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>Full funding sources listed at the end of the paper (see Acknowledgments).</p>","container-title":"The Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32252-3","ISSN":"0140-6736, 1474-547X","issue":"0","language":"English","source":"www.thelancet.com","title":"Associations of fats and carbohydrate intake with cardiovascular disease and mortality in 18 countries from five continents (PURE): a prospective cohort study","title-short":"Associations of fats and carbohydrate intake with cardiovascular disease and mortality in 18 countries from five continents (PURE)","URL":"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32252-3/abstract","volume":"0","author":[{"family":"Dehghan","given":"Mahshid"},{"family":"Mente","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaohe"},{"family":"Swaminathan","given":"Sumathi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Mohan","given":"Viswanathan"},{"family":"Iqbal","given":"Romaina"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Rajesh"},{"family":"Wentzel-Viljoen","given":"Edelweiss"},{"family":"Rosengren","given":"Annika"},{"family":"Amma","given":"Leela Itty"},{"family":"Avezum","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Chifamba","given":"Jephat"},{"family":"Diaz","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Khatib","given":"Rasha"},{"family":"Lear","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Lopez-Jaramillo","given":"Patricio"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaoyun"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Rajeev"},{"family":"Mohammadifard","given":"Noushin"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Oguz","given":"Aytekin"},{"family":"Ramli","given":"Anis Safura"},{"family":"Seron","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Szuba","given":"Andrzej"},{"family":"Tsolekile","given":"Lungiswa"},{"family":"Wielgosz","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Yusuf","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Yusufali","given":"Afzal Hussein"},{"family":"Teo","given":"Koon K."},{"family":"Rangarajan","given":"Sumathy"},{"family":"Dagenais","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Bangdiwala","given":"Shrikant I."},{"family":"Islam","given":"Shofiqul"},{"family":"Anand","given":"Sonia S."},{"family":"Yusuf","given":"Salim"},{"family":"Diaz","given":"R."},{"family":"Orlandini","given":"A."},{"family":"Linetsky","given":"B."},{"family":"Toscanelli","given":"S."},{"family":"Casaccia","given":"G."},{"family":"Cuneo","given":"JM Maini"},{"family":"Rahman","given":"O."},{"family":"Yusuf","given":"R."},{"family":"Azad","given":"A.

  {"id":"Taylor2002","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The architectural terracottas of Cosa, found in great quantities around the town's temples, were sorted into an elaborate morphology in the 1950s. This morphology is often cited as a basis for the chronologies and histories of the temples and as a model by which to date other Roman or Etrusco-Italic temples in north Italy. This article offers a criticism of the model applied to the molded terracotta plaques and suggests a simpler chronology constituting two major phases, one before the sack of Cosa in 70 B.C.E. and the other dating from the Augustan resettlement. The existence of an early \"Temple of Jupiter,\" presumed to have been directly behind the Capitolium, is questioned; and the square structure under the Capitolium, known popularly as Cosa Quadrata, is reinterpreted as the first and only temple on the Arx during the first colonization from 293 to 197 B.C.E. The terracottas found in the construction fill of the Capitolium belonged principally to this structure, while the large array of later subtypes in the area can be accorded to two major phases of a lavishly decorated Capitolium. Temples B and D are each reconstructed with a single major decorative phase, which in the case of the latter may have changed somewhat after the temple was remodeled.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.2307/507189","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"1","page":"59-83","source":"JSTOR","title":"Temples and Terracottas at Cosa","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/507189","volume":"106","author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Rabun"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

  {"id":"Seltzer2017-3","type":"webpage","abstract":"Sweet Briar College will cut its sticker price by about a third next year, it said Wednesday in an announcement that also detailed a series of planned curricular changes. The small private women’s college in rural Virginia will drop its advertised price for tuition, room, board and fees by 32 percent, to $34,000, for the 2018-19 academic year. Both new and returning students will be covered by the change. Next year’s price cut is a tuition reset, a strategy that has been drawing interest at many private colleges and universities recently. Tuition resets have been pitched as a way to counter the rise of tuition discounting -- the near-ubiquitous practice of institutions regularly raising their sticker prices but also offsetting their price hikes by offering increasing amounts of financial aid. In theory, tuition resets can attract more students by grabbing attention or by convincing students that they can pay for colleges that previously seemed too expensive. But resets’ chances of success remain controversial. Sweet Briar will be resetting tuition just three years after it nearly closed. Its former board announced plans in March 2015 to shut down the college at the end of that academic year, despite the fact it had a considerable endowment, pointing to a rising tuition discount rate, poor admissions trends and the challenge of recruiting students to a rural women’s college. Alumnae fought the closure and won a court battle to keep the college open under new leadership. Currently, Sweet Briar’s tuition discount rate fluctuates between 65 percent and 68 percent, according to its president, Meredith Woo. After the tuition reset, the discount rate is expected to drop below 40 percent. “It opens us up in a transparent, honest and simple way to families that really want to understand what’s available for their children,” Woo said. “We also want to make it very clear that at that rate, we are actually competitive, price-wise, with flagship public universities.” The University of Virginia estimates a yearly cost of attendance of over $31,000 for new in-state students in its College of Arts and Sciences, before financial aid. It estimates roughly $62,000 to $63,000 for out-of-state residents. Sweet Briar will also be rolling out substantial curricular changes next year. The college is revising its core curriculum around women’s leadership and reorganizing its academic departments into three interdisciplinary centers. It is also changing from 15-week semesters to a 3-12-12-3-week schedule. The new schedule’s short terms will allow for research, internship and study abroad. Woo wrote about some of the curricular changes at the end of August in a letter that also said Sweet Briar enrolled a new class of 95 students this year. But the college’s announcement Wednesday included new details, including that every undergraduate student will be eligible to receive up to $2,000 to fund experiential learning. The near-simultaneous announcement of the tuition reset and curricular revamp come amid a period of change for the rebooted Sweet Briar. Woo started as president in May, taking over for the retiring Phillip C. Stone, who was brought in to lead the college after alumnae stopped its closure. “We studied it very carefully,” Woo said of timing the tuition-reset announcement. “We discussed it with the Board of Directors very intensely, and we decided that the right time to do it is when we are coming up with new academic ideas.”","container-title":"Inside Higher Ed","title":"Sweet Briar Will Reset Tuition","URL":"https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/09/07/sweet-briar-will-reset-tuition","author":[{"family":"Seltzer","given":"Rick"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,7]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,7]]}},

Its peculiar elongated and narrow plan, first proposed in 1835, and its location at the highest point of the ancient city have dictated our understanding of the urban layout of Barcino by conditioning the shape of the city's forum and affecting the interpretation of the archaeological excavations carried out in the area since then. This paper proposes an alternative plan of the temple, based on data drawn from recent archaeological excavations, topographical analysis, typological comparisons, and the study of written sources. Our alternative hypothesis for the temple permits an in-depth reinterpretation of the plan of the forum and the evolution of the urban plan.","container-title":"Oxford Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.1111/ojoa.12028","ISSN":"1468-0092","issue":"1","language":"en","page":"89-107","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Augustan Temple and Forum of the Colony of Barcino: A 90 Degree Turn","title-short":"The Augustan Temple and Forum of the Colony of Barcino","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ojoa.12028/abstract","volume":"33","author":[{"family":"Orengo","given":"Hector A."},{"family":"Cortés","given":"Ada"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,9]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,1]]},"container-title-short":"OJA"},

What is happening with the 2 % of papers that reject AGW? We examine a selection of papers rejecting AGW. An analytical tool has been developed to replicate and test the results and methods used in these studies; our replication reveals a number of methodological flaws, and a pattern of common mistakes emerges that is not visible when looking at single isolated cases. Thus, real-life scientific disputes in some cases can be resolved, and we can learn from mistakes. A common denominator seems to be missing contextual information or ignoring information that does not fit the conclusions, be it other relevant work or related geophysical data. In many cases, shortcomings are due to insufficient model evaluation, leading to results that are not universally valid but rather are an artifact of a particular experimental setup. Other typical weaknesses include false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods, or basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics. We also argue that science is never settled and that both mainstream and contrarian papers must be subject to sustained scrutiny. The merit of replication is highlighted and we discuss how the quality of the scientific literature may benefit from replication.","container-title":"Theoretical and Applied Climatology","DOI":"10.1007/s00704-015-1597-5","ISSN":"0177-798X, 1434-4483","issue":"3-4","language":"en","page":"699-703","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Learning from mistakes in climate research","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-015-1597-5","volume":"126","author":[{"family":"Benestad","given":"Rasmus E."},{"family":"Nuccitelli","given":"Dana"},{"family":"Lewandowsky","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Hayhoe","given":"Katharine"},{"family":"Hygen","given":"Hans Olav"},{"family":"Dorland","given":"Rob","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Cook","given":"John"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,15]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]]},"container-title-short":"Theor Appl Climatol"},

  {"id":"Vasaly2015","type":"book","abstract":"\"This volume explores the political implications of the first five books of Livy's celebrated history of Rome, challenging the common perception of the author as an apolitical moralist. Ann Vasaly argues that Livy intended to convey through the narration of particular events crucial lessons about the interaction of power and personality, including the personality of the Roman people as a whole. These lessons demonstrate the means by which the Roman republic flourished in the distant past and by which it might be revived in Livy's own corrupt time. Written at the precise moment when Augustus' imperial autocracy was replacing the republican system that had existed in Rome for almost 500 years, the stories of the first pentad offer invaluable insight into how republics and monarchies work. Vasaly's innovative study furthers the integration in recent scholarship of the literary brilliance of Livy's text and the seriousness of its purpose\"--","call-number":"PA6459 .V37 2015","ISBN":"978-1-107-06567-3","number-of-pages":"209","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Livy's political philosophy: power and personality in early Rome","title-short":"Livy's political philosophy","author":[{"family":"Vasaly","given":"Ann"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"publisher-place":"New York"},

All of Wheelock's assets and liabilities will be transferred to BU June 1, 2018, provided regulators approve. The agreement comes several weeks after the two institutions announced in August that they had started merger talks. Wheelock, by far the smaller of the two institutions, was seeking a merger partner as it faced enrollment and financial challenges. A new school of education, the Wheelock College of Education and Human Development, will be created by the merger as BU's School of Education is combined with Wheelock's School of Education, Child Life and Family Studies. Income from Wheelock's endowment will go toward the new college. Current Wheelock students in good standing will be able to finish their academic programs at BU. They will become students in existing BU programs, continue to study in Wheelock programs being incorporated into BU or enroll in transitional programs in which they will finish their Wheelock courses of study. Tuition for current Wheelock students will remain at Wheelock levels but will be subject to the same annual percentage increases applied to BU students. Financial aid packages guaranteed by Wheelock will not be changed. All students seeking admission after the merger's completion will be subject to BU admissions requirements and tuition. The two institutions have agreed on a process for transferring tenured Wheelock faculty members to positions at BU. Nontenured Wheelock faculty will be considered individually for positions at BU based on program need, and Wheelock staff will be considered for positions at BU. As soon as the merger is completed, Wheelock's campus will be used for BU academic programs. David Chard, the president of Wheelock, will become interim dean of the new Wheelock College of Education and Human Development starting June 1. He will be appointed to that position for at least two years. “I believe this merger is our strongest option for preserving the mission of Wheelock College and the legacy of Lucy Wheelock long into the future, and I am pleased that we have reached this milestone,” Chard said in a statement. “[BU] President [Robert] Brown and I have discussed our intent to support Wheelock students and alumni during this transition and welcome them as part of the Boston University community.”","container-title":"Inside Higher Ed","title":"BU and Wheelock Reach Merger Agreement","URL":"https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/10/12/bu-and-wheelock-reach-merger-agreement","author":[{"family":"Seltzer","given":"Rick"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,12]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,12]]}},

This article examines one of the illustrations of the months which, since its discovery in the seventeenth century, has presented problems of interpretation for historians of art and of religion alike. The representation of April has been understood as a depiction of the rite of the pagan festival of Venus, noted on 1 April. The iconographic and historical problems attendant upon this traditional interpretation can be resolved by examining the proper historical context of the image. The representation of April in the Calendar can be better understood as the illustration of the Roman festival of the Magna Mater, celebrated in Rome in A. D. 354 from 4 to 10 April. This new explanation of the image of April has wide-ranging iconographic and religious significance.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.2307/504597","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"1","page":"43-50","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Representation of April in the Calendar of 354","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/504597","volume":"88","author":[{"family":"Salzman","given":"Michele Renee"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,15]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1984]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

  {"id":"Way2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"A scientist may publish tens or hundreds of papers over a career, but these contributions are not evenly spaced in time. Sixty years of studies on career productivity patterns in a variety of fields suggest an intuitive and universal pattern: Productivity tends to rise rapidly to an early peak and then gradually declines. Here, we test the universality of this conventional narrative by analyzing the structures of individual faculty productivity time series, constructed from over 200,000 publications and matched with hiring data for 2,453 tenure-track faculty in all 205 PhD-granting computer science departments in the United States and Canada. Unlike prior studies, which considered only some faculty or some institutions, or lacked common career reference points, here we combine a large bibliographic dataset with comprehensive information on career transitions that covers an entire field of study. We show that the conventional narrative confidently describes only one-fifth of faculty, regardless of department prestige or researcher gender, and the remaining four-fifths of faculty exhibit a rich diversity of productivity patterns. To explain this diversity, we introduce a simple model of productivity trajectories and explore correlations between its parameters and researcher covariates, showing that departmental prestige predicts overall individual productivity and the timing of the transition from first- to last-author publications. These results demonstrate the unpredictability of productivity over time and open the door for new efforts to understand how environmental and individual factors shape scientific productivity.","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1702121114","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","page":"201702121","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The misleading narrative of the canonical faculty productivity trajectory","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/10/16/1702121114","author":[{"family":"Way","given":"Samuel F."},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Allison C."},{"family":"Clauset","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Larremore","given":"Daniel B."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,17]]},"PMID":"29042510","container-title-short":"PNAS"},

Some opinions on the problem of citizenship and connected legal measures are reviewed. Finally, the paper outlines the universal extension of Roman citizenship with the constitutio Antoniniana which starts the late antiquity epilogue on the matter of the legal gap between Roman and foreign citizens.","container-title":"Cultura giuridica e diritto vivente","DOI":"10.14276/2384-8901/484","ISSN":"2384-8901","issue":"0","language":"it","source":"ojs.uniurb.it","title":"Commercium, Conubium, Migratio.

Traditional accounts state that Joseph Scaliger (1540-1609) created this field by combining philological with astronomical data and techniques. But the celestial phenomena most relevant to chronology are solar and lunar eclipses. From antiquity onwards, astrologers saw these as ominous and connected them to great events on earth. Though Scaliger used dated eclipses in his work, it was a number of relatively obscure sixteenth-century astronomers and scholars who realized that one could date events by eclipses and began doing so in a systematic way, without assigning them any ominous force.","container-title":"Journal of the History of Ideas","DOI":"10.1353/jhi.2003.0024","ISSN":"1086-3222","issue":"2","page":"213-229","source":"Project MUSE","title":"Some Uses of Eclipses in Early Modern Chronology","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43509","volume":"64","author":[{"family":"Grafton","given":"Anthony"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,27]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,6,9]]}},

  {"id":"Humm2013","type":"book","abstract":"En partant du rôle-clé joué par Appius Claudius Caecus, cette étude renouvelle la vision de l’histoire sociale, institutionnelle et culturelle de la Rome médio-républicaine (fin IVe – début IIIe siècle av. J.-C.). L’époque à laquelle se situe l’activité publique de ce personnage correspond en effet à un moment essentiel de l’histoire de la Rome républicaine, lorsque le vieux conflit patricio-plébéien cède la place à une forme de consensus politique qui s’est constitué autour des valeurs communes d’une nouvelle noblesse, née du partage des magistratures entre le patriciat et l’élite de la plèbe, et qui s’est renforcé avec les premiers pas de l’expansion romaine en Italie, notamment en direction de la Campanie. Au cours de cette époque cruciale, encore souvent négligée dans les études récentes sur l’Antiquité romaine, la République romaine a connu d’immenses bouleversements à la fois internes et externes qui ont en grande partie jeté les bases de son avenir. Dans ce contexte se placent les réformes institutionnelles de la censure de 312, rendues si confuses par les multiples interprétations des Anciens et des Modernes. Cet ouvrage montre l’unité d’ensemble de ces réformes qui ont conduit à la réorganisation civique du peuple romain et de son aristocratie (équestre et sénatoriale) selon les principes de l’égalité géométrique. Depuis B. G. Niebuhr et Th. Mommsen, on considère généralement que le célèbre censeur a joué un rôle important dans l’introduction de l’hellénisme à Rome : dans quelle mesure la présence et l’influence de l’hellénisme en Italie ont-elles pu fournir des modèles culturels ou idéologiques aux réformes alors entreprises ? Appius Claudius Caecus peut ainsi devenir le point de départ d’une réflexion d’ensemble sur les institutions, la société et l’univers culturel de Rome à l’époque « médio-républicaine », et de cette manière fournir, entre les origines semi-légendaires du régime républicain et l’époque mieux connue de la République finissante, le « chaînon manquant » pour comprendre la mise en place, dans sa forme quasi définitive et accomplie, du système politique, institutionnel et idéologique de la République romaine.","collection-title":"Bibliothèque des Écoles françaises d’Athènes et de Rome","ISBN":"978-2-7283-1026-5","language":"fr","number-of-pages":"X-779","publisher":"Publications de l’École française de Rome","source":"OpenEdition Books","title":"Appius Claudius Caecus: La République accomplie","title-short":"Appius Claudius Caecus","URL":"http://books.openedition.org/efr/1581","author":[{"family":"Humm","given":"Michel"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,22]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,23]]},"publisher-place":"Rome"},

  {"id":"Tomkins2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In this paper we study the implications for conference program committees of using single-blind reviewing, in which committee members are aware of the names and affiliations of paper authors, versus double-blind reviewing, in which this information is not visible to committee members. WSDM 2017, the 10th ACM International ACM Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, performed a controlled experiment in which each paper was reviewed by four committee members. Two of these four reviewers were chosen from a pool of committee members who had access to author information; the other two were chosen from a disjoint pool who did not have access to this information. This information asymmetry persisted through the process of bidding for papers, reviewing papers, and entering scores. Reviewers in the single-blind condition typically bid for 22% fewer papers, and preferentially bid for papers from top institutions. Once papers were allocated to reviewers, single-blind reviewers were significantly more likely than their double-blind counterparts to recommend for acceptance papers from famous authors and top institutions. The estimated odds multipliers are 1.63 for famous authors and 1.58 and 2.10 for top universities and companies respectively, so the result is tangible. For female authors, the associated odds multiplier of 0.78 is not statistically significant in our study. However, a meta-analysis places this value in line with that of other experiments, and in the context of this larger aggregate the gender effect is also statistically significant.","container-title":"arXiv:1702.00502 [cs]","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Single versus Double Blind Reviewing at WSDM 2017","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00502","author":[{"family":"Tomkins","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Min"},{"family":"Heavlin","given":"William D."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,1]]}},

First, two views in principles of bloomery process are presented. Next, tree ancient texts of Hippocrates, Aristotle and Pliny related to steel production, are given, with possible comments on cast iron production. Cast iron objects, dated to ancient and middle ages periods, found in Europe sites,are mentioned. It is well known the first furnaces able to produce regularly both bloomery iron and cast iron, were high bloomeries, known as Styria type Stücköfen. Smelting of cast iron produced a different kind of slag and finds of such type of slag are also discussed. Next attention is paid to heterogeneously carburized iron blooms with parts close to cast iron by composition and structure. Finaly, some remarks on beginning of blast furnace process are given.","container-title":"Acta Metallurgica Slovaca","page":"97-101","title":"Cast iron in the European bloomery period","volume":"7","author":[{"family":"Pleiner","given":"Radomír"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]}},

  {"id":"Neer2001","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Thêsauroi, or treasure-houses, are small, temple-like structures, found typically in the sanctuaries of Delphi and Olympia. They were built by Greek city-states to house the dedications of their citizens. But a thêsauros is not just a storeroom: it is also a frame for costly votives, a way of diverting elite display in the interest of the city. When placed on view in a treasure-house, the individual dedication is re-contextualized: although it still reflects well on its dedicant, it also glorifies the polis. Thêsauroi effectively nationalize votives—and, with them, a dedicant's privileged relationship to the gods. The sculptural program of the Siphnian treasury exemplifies these issues.","container-title":"Classical Antiquity","DOI":"10.1525/ca.2001.20.2.273","ISSN":"0278-6656","issue":"2","page":"273-344","source":"JSTOR","title":"Framing the Gift: The Politics of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi","title-short":"Framing the Gift","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/ca.2001.20.2.273","volume":"20","author":[{"family":"Neer","given":"Richard T."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,16]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]}},

  {"id":"Biondo2018","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The largely dominant meritocratic paradigm of highly competitive Western cultures is rooted on the belief that success is due mainly, if not exclusively, to personal qualities such as talent, intelligence, skills, efforts or risk taking. Sometimes, we are willing to admit that a certain degree of luck could also play a role in achieving significant material success. But, as a matter of fact, it is rather common to underestimate the importance of external forces in individual successful stories. It is very well known that intelligence or talent exhibit a Gaussian distribution among the population, whereas the distribution of wealth - considered a proxy of success - follows typically a power law (Pareto law). Such a discrepancy between a Normal distribution of inputs, with a typical scale, and the scale invariant distribution of outputs, suggests that some hidden ingredient is at work behind the scenes. In this paper, with the help of a very simple agent-based model, we suggest that such an ingredient is just randomness. In particular, we show that, if it is true that some degree of talent is necessary to be successful in life, almost never the most talented people reach the highest peaks of success, being overtaken by mediocre but sensibly luckier individuals. As to our knowledge, this counterintuitive result - although implicitly suggested between the lines in a vast literature - is quantified here for the first time. It sheds new light on the effectiveness of assessing merit on the basis of the reached level of success and underlines the risks of distributing excessive honors or resources to people who, at the end of the day, could have been simply luckier than others. With the help of this model, several policy hypotheses are also addressed and compared to show the most efficient strategies for public funding of research in order to improve meritocracy, diversity and innovation.","container-title":"arXiv:1802.07068 [physics]","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Talent vs Luck: the role of randomness in success and failure","title-short":"Talent vs Luck","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068","author":[{"family":"Biondo","given":"A.

  {"id":"Padgett2017","type":"book","abstract":"The Berlin Painter was the name given by British classicist and art historian Sir John Beazley to an otherwise anonymous Athenian red-figure vase-painter. The artist's long career extended from about 500 B.C. well into the 460s, and his elegant renderings of daily life and mythological stories offer invaluable insight into the social, political, religious, and artistic workings of early 5th-century Athens. Since the first published identification of the artist in 1911, the Berlin Painter's oeuvre has grown to nearly 350 works, both complete pots and fragments, making him one of the best-known artists of his kind. This lavishly illustrated publication features nine essays by leading scholars who explore the artist's work, milieu, influence, and legacy, as well as the role of connoisseurship in art-historical scholarship. With an updated catalogue raisonne that includes many newly attributed works, it is the definitive book on this seminal artist.00Exhibition: Princeton university Art Museum, Princeton, USA (04.03-11.06.2017); Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, USA (07.07-01.10.2017)","call-number":"938.09","ISBN":"978-0-300-22593-8 978-0-943012-18-6","note":"OCLC: ocn969981633","number-of-pages":"430","publisher":"Princeton University Art Museum","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The Berlin painter and his world: Athenian vase-painting in the early fifth century B.C","title-short":"The Berlin painter and his world","editor":[{"family":"Padgett","given":"J.

  {"id":"Armstrong2016","type":"book","abstract":"\"While copious amounts have been written about the Roman army, most study has focussed on the later Republic or the Imperial period when the legionary system was already well-developed. Here Dr. Jeremy Armstrong traces the development of Rome's military might from its earliest discernible origins down to the First Punic War. He shows how her armies evolved from ad-hoc forces of warriors organized along clan lines and assembled for the city's survival, to the sophisticated organization of the legions that went on to dominate all of Italy and then (after the period covered) the entire Mediterranean world. The author reviews both the literary sources and the latest archaeological evidence to provide a fresh analysis of Roman military organization, equipment, tactics and strategy. He shows how Rome's military apparatus adapted to meet the changing strategic needs of new enemies and broader ambitions. This study of the origins of the Classical world's most formidable war machine will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in Classical, and especially Roman, military history.\"--Dust jacket.","ISBN":"978-1-78159-254-0 1-78159-254-3","language":"English","note":"OCLC: 964302175","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Early Roman warfare: from the regal period to the First Punic War","title-short":"Early Roman warfare","author":[{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Jeremy"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]}},

  {"id":"Seltzer2018","type":"webpage","abstract":"Another round of cost cutting is under way at Antioch College, with faculty and staff members who earn more than $40,000 per year being required to take mandatory furloughs and a de facto hiring freeze being put in place. Affected faculty and staff at the small college in Yellow Springs, Ohio, will need to take 10 days of unpaid leave before June 30, according to The Yellow Springs News. That’s the equivalent of an 11 percent pay cut over the next several months, or 3.8 percent of their annual salaries. No jobs are being eliminated. Antioch has 118 staff members and 31 faculty members, not including adjuncts. The furlough requirement effectively covers all full-time faculty members but less than half of nonfaculty staff members. Adjuncts will not have to take furloughs. The cuts will not completely eliminate a shortfall in the current budget, Antioch president Tom Manley told The Yellow Springs News. He did not share the size of the college’s current deficit, but it closed its last fiscal year with a $1.73 million gap in a budget of $17.6 million. Last year’s deficit shrank from $7 million the year before as the college in 2016 put cuts in place that included the elimination of five positions and decreased salaries for 23 administrators. Antioch enrolls just 133 students after struggling with admissions in the fall. The college, which is attempting to transition from a free model to one where students pay, netted $1.7 million in tuition and fee revenue last year. It relies on gifts for much of its revenue. Antioch College was closed by Antioch University in 2008, but a group led by alumni purchased the rights to the liberal arts campus and its endowment, reopening the institution in 2011. The college offered full-tuition scholarships for several years after reopening. Now, it is also looking for savings from its contracts and consultants. The college is searching for attrition opportunities, holding vacant positions open and not filling voluntary leaves and retirements -- implementing a de facto hiring freeze. At the same time, Antioch leaders are attempting to grow revenue and diversify their sources of income. They will try to find the right balance between fiscal responsibility and reinvention, Manley told The Yellow Springs News.","container-title":"Inside Higher Ed","language":"en","title":"Antioch College Furloughs Faculty and Staff | Inside Higher Ed","URL":"https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/03/20/antioch-college-furloughs-faculty-and-staff","author":[{"family":"Seltzer","given":"Rick"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,20]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,20]]}},

  {"id":"Seltzer2018-1","type":"webpage","abstract":"A total of 111 employees will be laid off as a result of Wheelock College’s merger into Boston University -- 72 staff members and 39 faculty members. The employees will lose their jobs after the merger becomes official June 1, The Boston Globe reported last week. The layoffs represent a majority of Wheelock employees, as Boston University offered positions to 93 of the college’s employees. About a third of those Wheelock employees being offered jobs are tenured faculty members. Those losing their jobs include both full-time and part-time faculty members. But all Wheelock tenured faculty members are being offered positions, according to a release from BU. “We have been anticipating this point even before the merger was announced,” David Chard, Wheelock’s president, said in a statement. “Losing talented staff and faculty is very difficult, particularly in a tight-knit, mission-driven community like Wheelock. However, as a result of this merger, Boston University has offered us a unique opportunity to retain the academic knowledge and expertise of Wheelock’s tenured faculty and the capacity of many of our high-quality staff members that will ensure the success of the new Wheelock College of Education and Human Development.” That’s the name of the new college to be created under a merger agreement announced in October that will have Wheelock’s School of Education, Child Life and Family Studies merging with BU’s School of Education. The announcement came several months after BU and Wheelock first revealed former merger discussions in August. Wheelock was facing financial and enrollment challenges. Employees losing their jobs will receive severance packages and outplacement services, said Diane Tucker, Boston University’s vice president for human resources. “This is the very difficult and painful part of the merger,” she said in a statement. “It’s hard for people to lose jobs through no fault of their own. We are committed to helping impacted employees with their job search.”","container-title":"Inside Higher Ed","language":"en","title":"Boston University Reveals Layoffs in Wheelock Merger","URL":"https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/03/21/boston-university-reveals-layoffs-wheelock-merger","author":[{"family":"Seltzer","given":"Rick"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,21]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,21]]}},

  {"id":"Arias2004","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Much of the economic education literature suggests that the principles of economics class size does not significantly affect student performance. However, study methods have varied in terms of the aggregation level (student or class), the measure of performance (TUCE or course letter grade), and the class size measure (e.g., students who completed both the TUCE pretest and posttest). The authors perform an experiment with principles students using total exam points as the dependent variable in a model to explain student performance, By using the same instructor for all sections, the authors control variation in instruction, lecture material, and topic coverage; they also account for variation in student abilities. In contrast to many other studies, the authors find statistically significant evidence that small class size has a positive impact on student performance.","container-title":"Journal of Economic Education","ISSN":"0022-0485","issue":"4","language":"en","page":"311-329","source":"ERIC","title":"Additional Evidence on the Relationship between Class Size and Student Performance","volume":"35","author":[{"family":"Arias","given":"J.

We discuss the implications of these small effects and show that they are meaningful and have important consequences. Results also indicate that the effectiveness of first-year seminars for both criteria is substantially moderated by first-year seminar characteristics (e.g., type of seminar), institutional characteristics (e.g., 2-year or 4-year institution), and study characteristics (e.g., study design). We use these results to make recommendations about the design of first-year seminars that can maximize the positive effect on both the grades and retention of participants.","container-title":"Review of Educational Research","DOI":"10.3102/0034654315584955","ISSN":"0034-6543","issue":"1","language":"en","page":"277-316","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Do First-Year Seminars Improve College Grades and Retention?

  {"id":"Johnson2018","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This study examined the relationship between 10 high-impact practices and graduation rates at four-year public colleges and universities in the United States. The Association of American Colleges and Universities defined high-impact practices as especially effective for student learning, engagement, and career preparation in the 21st century. While advocacy for these practices and their inclusion in undergraduate curricula is growing, little research has examined their relationship to institutional outcomes. Based on data from 101 participating institutions, this study used both primary and secondary data to investigate whether offering high-impact practices as required for all students, required for some students, or optional was related to an institution’s four or six-year graduation rate. The findings suggest that high-impact practices are in widespread use across different institutional types but have limited relationships with graduation rates. This study contributes to the body of literature on college completion. Findings suggest that offering high-impact practices may not lead to increased graduation rates at public institutions.","container-title":"The Journal of Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/00221546.2018.1441107","ISSN":"0022-1546, 1538-4640","language":"en","page":"1-29","source":"Crossref","title":"Academic Engagement and Student Success: Do High-Impact Practices Mean Higher Graduation Rates?","title-short":"Academic Engagement and Student Success","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00221546.2018.1441107","author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Sarah Randall"},{"family":"Stage","given":"Frances King"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,25]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,11]]}},

  {"id":"Woods1985","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Thomas Jefferson's arrangement of buildings around an open lawn at the University of Virginia represents an innovative approach to collegiate planning. Yet it is not this plan but the individual structures that have dominated architectural discussions of the university. While prototypes for the latter have been meticulously researched, the origins of the university plan have remained relatively unexplored. Focusing on the University of Virginia as an institutional building type, this study relates its plan to hospital and school designs available to Jefferson through either his library or professional contacts. It reveals his appreciation of the university as a self-contained community-the academic village-and his sensitivity to the effect of the architectural arrangement on education, discipline, health, and morale.","container-title":"Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians","DOI":"10.2307/990076","ISSN":"00379808, 21505926","issue":"3","page":"266-283","source":"Crossref","title":"Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia: Planning the Academic Village","title-short":"Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia","URL":"http://jsah.ucpress.edu/cgi/doi/10.2307/990076","volume":"44","author":[{"family":"Woods","given":"Mary N."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,5]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1985,10]]}},

Although un- guided or minimally guided instructional approaches are very popular and intuitively appeal- ing, the point is made that these approaches ignore both the structures that constitute human cognitive architecture and evidence from empirical studies over the past half-century that con- sistently indicate that minimally guided instruction is less effective and less efficient than in- structional approaches that place a strong emphasis on guidance of the student learning pro- cess.

  {"id":"Landeschi2018","type":"article-journal","abstract":"For over 30 years GIS has been a major theme in archaeology, leading scholars to debate the way geo-spatial platforms can contribute to a better understanding of the ancient landscape and a more thorough interpretation of the archaeological record. Recently, the introduction of more advanced software and hardware solutions have made it possible to use GIS for visualizing and analysing even geometrically complex 3D contents, in a totally unprecedented way. Still, a theoretical debate on the way three-dimensionality could impact GIS-based research has yet to come and only a few pioneering projects have been conducted to show the potential for the discipline. Among the possible lines of enquiry to be developed in this direction, sensory archaeology seems to be one to benefit more from such an approach. Starting from a review of the current state of research this contribution will attempt to show some important results recently obtained in order to generate some insights on theoretical and methodological issues raised by the use of state-of-the-art 3D GIS and to trace new paths for the future.","container-title":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.2018.1463171","ISSN":"0043-8243, 1470-1375","language":"en","page":"1-16","source":"Crossref","title":"Rethinking GIS, three-dimensionality and space perception in archaeology","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00438243.2018.1463171","author":[{"family":"Landeschi","given":"Giacomo"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,11]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,4]]}},

  {"id":"Rosman1997","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The pollution history of the atmosphere of the Northern Hemisphere is recorded in the levels of heavy metal impurities in Greenland ice. The possibility also exists of using natural variations in the abundances of lead isotopes to trace the source of this pollution. Lead isotopes have now been measured in ancient Greenland ice with a lead concentration as low as 0.9 pg/g. The results show a depression in the 206Pb/207Pb ratio between 600 B.C. and 300 A.D., giving unequivocal evidence of early large-scale atmospheric pollution by this toxic metal. This ratio changes from ∼1.201 in ∼8-kyr-old ice to ∼1.183 about 2 kyr ago. Isotopic systematics point to the mining districts in southwest and southeast Spain as the dominant sources of this lead, giving quantitative evidence of the importance of these mining districts to the Carthaginian and Roman civilizations. Lead with a Rio Tinto-type signature represents ∼70% of the lead found in Greenland ice between ∼150 B.C. and 50 A.D. after correcting for the contribution from rock dust indexed to aluminium concentrations.","container-title":"Environmental Science & Technology","DOI":"10.1021/es970038k","ISSN":"0013-936X, 1520-5851","issue":"12","language":"en","page":"3413-3416","source":"Crossref","title":"Lead from Carthaginian and Roman Spanish Mines Isotopically Identified in Greenland Ice Dated from 600 B.C. to 300 A.D.","URL":"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es970038k","volume":"31","author":[{"family":"Rosman","given":"Kevin J.

  {"id":"Chamorro1987","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In this paper a synthesis of Spanish archaeological studies and excavation reports providing evidence for the famed Tartessos is presented. In contrast to earlier investigations based solely on philological sources, the problem of Tartessos is examined from an archaeological point of view, summarizing research conducted systematically over the past 25 years. The archaeological materials investigated in Portugal and Spain allow the reconstruction of the problematic pre-Colonial Late Bronze Age Phase (900-750 B. C.) and the much better known Orientalizing Phase (750-550 B. C.). The trade routes established by Phoenicians and Greeks within the Iberian Peninsula and across the Mediterranean present Tartessos as an El Dorado of early commerce. The accumulation of silver necessary for the development of coinage in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean may have had its origin in the silver mines of Huelva in Spain where important metallurgical activity is verified from the ninth century B. C. onwards. The oldest epigraphic alphabet in the Iberian Peninsula is reviewed within the context of Tartessian necropoli excavated in southern Portugal. Stelae with engraved Herzsprung shields, indicating elements of Tartessian funerary ritual, are also discussed. The recent discovery of fine Greek ware dated from 600-550 B. C. supports the identification of ancient Tartessos with the modern city of Huelva.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.2307/505217","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"2","page":"197-232","source":"JSTOR","title":"Survey of Archaeological Research on Tartessos","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/505217","volume":"91","author":[{"family":"Chamorro","given":"Javier G."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1987]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

The study hypothesized that country-based differences in schooling systems, socioeconomic development, culture or other factors might have an influence on preferred formats, print or electronic, for academic reading, as well as the learning engagement behaviors of students. The main findings are that country of origin has little to no relationship with or effect on reading format preferences of university students, and that the broad majority of students worldwide prefer to read academic course materials in print. The majority of participants report better focus and retention of information presented in print formats, and more frequently prefer print for longer texts. Additional demographic and post-hoc analysis suggests that format preference has a small relationship with academic rank. The relationship between task demands, format preferences and reading comprehension are discussed. Additional outcomes and implications for the fields of education, psychology, computer science, information science and human-computer interaction are considered.","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0197444","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","language":"en","page":"e0197444","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Academic reading format preferences and behaviors among university students worldwide: A comparative survey analysis","title-short":"Academic reading format preferences and behaviors among university students worldwide","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197444","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Mizrachi","given":"Diane"},{"family":"Salaz","given":"Alicia M."},{"family":"Kurbanoglu","given":"Serap"},{"family":"Boustany","given":"Joumana"},{"family":"Group","given":"on behalf of the ARFIS Research"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,4]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,30]]},"container-title-short":"PLOS ONE"},

  {"id":"Seltzer2018-2","type":"webpage","abstract":"Private college closures have risen to a rate of about 11 per year, and the rate at which campuses are shut down is expected to increase in the future, according to a new report published by Moody's Investors Service Tuesday. The report comes a few years after a notorious prediction the ratings agency made in September 2015 -- that closure activity would as much as triple and mergers would double by 2017. As of the prediction, private nonprofit closures were averaging five per year, meaning as many as 15 institutions could have been ending operations annually by 2017. Although the headline-grabbing tripling of closures has yet to come to fruition, a significant uptick has indeed taken place. And Moody's is still projecting a future increase in closures toward the range of 15 per year. Moody's has consistently noted that private colleges are tenacious in the face of pressure and that while it projected increasing closure rates, it was still predicting a relatively low closure rate of less than 1 percent annually that could add up if it were to continue over multiple years. Nonetheless, the ratings agency is pointing out that continued stress from falling tuition revenue and rising expenses will drive colleges to close, merge or make drastic changes like cutting a significant amount of programs. In the past, favorable demographics and growth in federal funding helped keep closure rates for private college low. But now, demographic changes, most notably in the Northeast and Midwest, are likely to create an “increasing amount of churn” in the higher education sector. A bottom group of about 750 small private colleges recording less than $100 million in total expenses is increasingly struggling to cover costs with revenue. The median net revenue per student for this group covered about 65 percent of the median expense per student in 2012. In 2016, it covered just 53 percent. The gap between revenue and expenses is becoming unsustainably high, Moody's found. About one in five small private colleges is under fundamental stress. While colleges have other sources of revenue, like gifts and endowment income, “for a few each year, these other sources will not be enough to make up for lost student charge revenue, leading to deep stress and existential questions,” the ratings agency wrote.","container-title":"Inside Higher Ed","language":"en","title":"Moody's: Private-College Closures at 11 Per Year | Inside Higher Ed","title-short":"Moody's","URL":"https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/07/25/moodys-private-college-closures-11-year","author":[{"family":"Seltzer","given":"Rick"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,26]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,25]]}},

A signal of institutional commitment to faculty diversity often includes the hiring of an executive level chief diversity officer (CDO). To examine the effects of a CDO in a broad panel data context, we combine unique data on the initial hiring of a CDO with publicly available faculty and administrator hiring data by race and ethnicity from 2001 to 2016 for four-year or higher U.S. universities categorized as Carnegie R1, R2, or M1 institutions with student populations of 4,000 or more. We are unable to find significant statistical evidence that preexisting growth in diversity for underrepresented racial/ethnic minority groups is affected by the hiring of an executive level diversity officer for new tenure and non-tenure track hires, faculty hired with tenure, or for university administrator hires.","genre":"Working Paper","number":"24969","publisher":"National Bureau of Economic Research","title":"The Impact of Chief Diversity Officers on Diverse Faculty Hiring","URL":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w24969","author":[{"family":"Bradley","given":"Steven W."},{"family":"Garven","given":"James R."},{"family":"Law","given":"Wilson W."},{"family":"West","given":"James E."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8]]},"DOI":"10.3386/w24969"},

  {"id":"Grimmer2013","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Many skilled professional occupations are characterized by an early period of intensive skill accumulation and career establishment. Examples include law firm associates, surgical residents, and unten- ured faculty at research-intensive universities. High female exit rates are sometimes blamed on the inability of new mothers to survive the sustained negative productivity shock associated with childbearing and early childrearing in these environments. Gender-neutral fam- ily policies have been adopted in some professions in an attempt to “level the playing field.” The gender-neutral tenure clock stopping policies adopted by the majority of research-intensive universities in the United States in recent decades are an excellent example. But to date, there is no empirical evidence showing that these policies help women. Using a unique dataset on the universe of assistant professor hires at top-50 economics departments from 1980–2005, we show that the adoption of gender-neutral tenure clock stopping policies substantially reduced female tenure rates while substantially increasing male tenure rates. However, these policies do not reduce the probability that either men or women eventually earn tenure in the profession.

These results show that Greek and Roman lead and silver mining and smelting activities polluted the middle troposphere of the Northern Hemisphere on a hemispheric scale two millennia ago, long before the Industrial Revolution. Cumulative lead fallout to the Greenland Ice Sheet during these eight centuries was as high as 15 percent of that caused by the massive use of lead alkyl additives in gasoline since the 1930s.

Yet, despite its regional fame and prominence, its remains have eluded archaeological identification. As a result, the location of the Artemision has been a vexed question in Euboean studies for over a century. Between 2003 and 2007, however, a new impetus was given to its localization. In collaboration with the Ephorate of Antiquities of Euboea, the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece (ESAG) carried out a large-scale geophysical survey in the area of Amarynthos, some 11km east of Eretria, at the foot of a hill locally known as Paleoekklisies (or Paleochora). The ensuing trial trenches were followed by systematic excavation that eventually led to the discovery of substantial buildings. We suggest that these buildings are part of a monumental complex that should be identified as the Sanctuary of Artemis Amarysia (see afterword).","container-title":"Archaeological Reports","DOI":"10.1017/S0570608418000121","ISSN":"0570-6084, 2041-4102","language":"en","page":"167-180","source":"Crossref","title":"Recent research at the Sanctuary of Artemis Amarysia in Amarynthos (Euboea)","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0570608418000121/type/journal_article","volume":"63","author":[{"family":"Fachard","given":"Sylvian"},{"family":"Knoepfler","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Reber","given":"Karl"},{"family":"Karapaschalidou","given":"Amalia"},{"family":"Krapf","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Theurillat","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Kalamara","given":"Pari"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,4]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,11]]}},

  {"id":"Cool2016","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper considers the small glass objects often called counters, which are common finds at Pompeii, and normally thought to have been used in playing games. An assemblage of over 500 stratigraphically dated examples from Insula VI.1 are examined, and the colour and size of this group are compared to a dataset of first-century ad glass counters found in graves where they can be shown with certainty to be part of gaming sets. The comparisons show that the bulk of the Pompeii counters are very unlikely to have been used in gaming, a conclusion that is supported by the types of counters that would have been necessary to play games such as ludus latrunculorum and ludus duodecim scriptorum. Other functions are considered and it is suggested that many of the Pompeiian counters might have been used for interior decoration. The rise of a specialist production of counters that could have been used in gaming is demonstrated, and it is suggested this might have implications for the development of craft specialization and demonstrate the rise of leisure time in the first century ad.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.1017/S0068246216000052","ISSN":"0068-2462, 2045-239X","language":"en","page":"157-177","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Recreation or decoration: What were the glass counters from Pompeii used for?","title-short":"RECREATION OR DECORATION","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/papers-of-the-british-school-at-rome/article/recreation-or-decoration-what-were-the-glass-counters-from-pompeii-used-for/D1FBCB5A987A8E42CEAAAF526A2C4C50/core-reader","volume":"84","author":[{"family":"Cool","given":"H.

It is a study of great importance as it gives a detailed historic and archaeological view of the funerary context of a Greek colony. Taphonomic studies of the tombs are of great interest to know the composition of the bodies in the graves and the rituals associated with the burial. Finally, the examination of hundreds of skeletons of children has provided data on child mortality. This report, briefly, also aims to present the restoration of the artifacts discovered. The article describes the organization of the restoration laboratory, built and equipped directly in situ at the excavation, the materials used during the restoration, the main problems presented during the various phases of restoration and several results.","container-title":"Conservation Science in Cultural Heritage","DOI":"10.6092/issn.1973-9494/7115","ISSN":"1974-4951, 1973-9494","issue":"2","language":"en","page":"27-40","source":"doaj.org","title":"Battles of Himera (480 and 409 b.c.): Analysis of Biological Finds and Historical Interpretation.

  {"id":"Harnett2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The adoption of the codex for literature in the Roman world was one of the most significant developments in the history of the book, yet remains poorly understood. Physical evidence seems to contradict literary evidence from Martial's epigrams. Near-total adoption of the codex for early Christian works, even as the book roll dominated non-Christian book forms in the first centuries of our era, has led to endless speculation about possible ideological motives for adoption. What has been unquestioned is the importance of Christian scribes in the surge of adoption from 300 C.E. onward. This article reexamines the foundation of many theories, the timeline for non-Christian adoption sketched by Roberts and Skeat in their study, The Birth of the Codex, and reevaluates it through the lens of “diffusion of innovations theory” in order to reconcile the evidence and elevate practical considerations once and for all over ideological motives.","container-title":"Classical Antiquity","DOI":"10.1525/ca.2017.36.2.183","ISSN":"0278-6656, 1067-8344","issue":"2","language":"en","page":"183-235","source":"Crossref","title":"The Diffusion of the Codex","URL":"http://ca.ucpress.edu/lookup/doi/10.1525/ca.2017.36.2.183","volume":"36","author":[{"family":"Harnett","given":"Benjamin"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,1]]},"container-title-short":"CA"},

  {"id":"Poehler2019","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In July 2014, we conducted a survey of Pompeii's street network to document traces of iron that were observed on the stone-paved streets, which resulted in the identification of 434 instances of solid iron and iron staining among the paving stones. This paper describes the iron deposits, categorizing them into six observable types, and argues that, in the final days and weeks before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 C.E., Pompeians were—in addition to using solid iron wedges—pouring molten iron and iron slag onto their streets as a method of emergency repair. Before discussing the evidence available for how the melting, transporting, and depositing of these ferric materials might have been accomplished, we address whether the Romans had the technical ability to achieve sufficiently high temperatures to melt iron, finding much evidence to affirm the claim that they did. Finally, we consider why Pompeians undertook such measures to repair their streets. Recent research on the costs of paving stone streets in terms of time, money, and opportunity provides the economic context for this novel repair process and shows the use of iron and iron slag to have been an expedient alternative.","archive":"JSTOR","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.3764/aja.123.2.0237","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"2","page":"237-262","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Iron Streets of Pompeii","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.123.2.0237","volume":"123","author":[{"family":"Poehler","given":"Eric E."},{"family":"Roggen","given":"Juliana","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Crowther","given":"Benjamin M."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

  {"id":"Mogetta2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Concrete is regarded as a quintessentially Roman achievement. The spread of the technology is usually dated to the fourth or third centuries B.C., and interpreted as a symptom of Rome's early expansion in Italy. In this paper I offer a reappraisal of the available evidence for early concrete construction in Rome. On the basis of stratigraphic evidence, I conclude that a later date should be assigned to most of the remains. I situate the origins of the technological innovation within the radical change in architectural styles that unfolded in the middle of the second century B.C., affecting both domestic architecture and public building. The new chronology has an impact on current models of cultural diffusion in Roman Italy, linking the development of Late Republican architecture with the broader debate on the cultural implications of the Roman conquest.","container-title":"The Journal of Roman Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S007543581500043X","ISSN":"0075-4358","page":"1-40","source":"JSTOR","title":"A New Date for Concrete in Rome","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26346892","volume":"105","author":[{"family":"Mogetta","given":"Marcello"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,7]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"container-title-short":"JRS"},

  {"id":"Dorothy2018","type":"book","abstract":"All too often, defining a discipline becomes more an exercise of exclusion than inclusion. Disrupting the Digital Humanities seeks to rethink how we map disciplinary terrain by directly confronting the gatekeeping impulse of many other so-called field-defining collections. What is most beautiful about the work of the Digital Humanities is exactly the fact that it can’t be tidily anthologized. In fact, the desire to neatly define the Digital Humanities (to filter the DH-y from the DH) is a way of excluding the radically diverse work that actually constitutes the field. This collection, then, works to push and prod at the edges of the Digital Humanities — to open the Digital Humanities rather than close it down. Ultimately, it’s exactly the fringes, the outliers, that make the Digital Humanities both heterogeneous and rigorous.\n\nThis collection does not constitute yet another reservoir for the new Digital Humanities canon. Rather, its aim is less about assembling content as it is about creating new conversations. Building a truly communal space for the digital humanities requires that we all approach that space with a commitment to: 1) creating open and non-hierarchical dialogues; 2) championing non-traditional work that might not otherwise be recognized through conventional scholarly channels; 3) amplifying marginalized voices; 4) advocating for students and learners; and 5) sharing generously and openly to support the work of our peers.","ISBN":"978-1-947447-71-4","language":"eng","publisher":"punctum books","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Disrupting the Digital Humanities","URL":"https://punctumbooks.com/titles/disrupting-the-digital-humanities/","editor":[{"family":"Dorothy","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Jesse","given":"Stommel"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,15]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"DOI":"10.21983/p3.0230.1.00"},

  {"id":"Torelli2013","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In 2006, the Soprintendenza Archeologica del Lazio began an excavation at the site of Fosso dell’Incastro on the coastline of Ardea. A well-preserved settlement buried under huge sand dunes was discovered, featuring a Roman castrum created in the fourth century BCE around a sanctuary dating back to the mid-sixth century BCE. Its characteristics not only suggested that the ancient site was Castrum Inui, previously known only through the ancient literary sources (e.g., Virgil, Servius and Macrobius), but also that its sanctuary could be attributed to an inconspicuous local deity, Inuus—often correlated with Pan and Sol. In its final phase (the early Imperial period), the sanctuary housed three sacred buildings: Temple A, Temple B, and a small shrine dedicated to Aesculapius. Temple B, the site of Inuus’ worship, was constructed in the Etrusco-Italic style during the first quarter of the fifth century BCE, while Temple A was built during the mid-second century BCE. Temple B was oriented to the southwest, one typical for religious buildings connected to chthonic cults; two altars built during the fourth century BCE were placed along the façade of the temple, one facing the east and on the axis of the temple, the second close to its southwest corner. It was also enhanced with an acroterion depicting the head of a warrior with the skin and horns of a goat or cow over his helmet, a motif that establishes a connection between Innus, Pan and Faunus. Temple A, on the other hand, faced the northeast and was enhanced with a sculpted pediment in high relief showing an assembly of gods and possibly Aeneas. Both its orientation and the iconography of the pediment suggest that it was dedicated to Aeneas Indiges, a pan-Latin version of the old cult of Inuus.","container-title":"Etruscan and Italic Studies","issue":"2","page":"263-286","title":"Innus: A God of Archaic Latium and His Sanctuary at Fosso dell’Incastro (Ardea)","volume":"16","author":[{"family":"Torelli","given":"Mario"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,11]]}},

  {"id":"Dentzer2002","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Les périodes les plus anciennes de l'histoire de l'urbanisme de Bosra restent mal connues mais des vestiges de l'âge du bronze sont attestés à présent à l'ouest et au centre de la ville et au sud. L'arc nabatéen sert de charnière entre l'orientation de la rue principale est-ouest et celle du nouveau quartier. Au centre ville, la création ou la transformation monumentale en rues à colonnades des deux grands axes remonte à l'époque sévérienne. Une importance politique particulière revient à la rue nord-sud, qui relie le centre ville à l'entrée du camp romain et où se multiplient les inscriptions officielles, dont certaines en latin. Une grande opération de rénovation est attestée dans les portiques et dans les monuments voisins aux IVe-Ve siècles. Sans doute à l'époque omeyyade tardive (?) commence la transformation en souqs des portiques divisés en boutiques, donnant à ces espaces un caractère commercial marqué qu'ils conservèrent jusqu'à l'arrivée des premiers voyageurs européens. /// The town planning of the earlier Bosra is not yet precisely known, even though some Bronze Age structures (W. and S.-W. city-wall) and artefacts have been recently found in the western part and in the center of the Graeco-Roman city. Like a hinge, the Nabataean arch complex links the main E.-W. street with the Ist century AD eastern nabataean district, of which the cross-ruled orientation is different. In the main streets of the Roman city center, the building of the columnaded porticoes is now accurately dated in the severan period by inscriptions. The numerous official inscriptions -- some of them in Latin -- found in the south-north street from the main E.-W. street to the Roman camp obviously demonstrate the political meaning of this urban axis. During the IVth and Vth centuries a large renovation of the porticoes and neighbouring buildings has been carried out. The transformation of the street porticoes into separate shops -- as in modern souqs -- has probably begun in the late omeyyad period. This architectural evolution has emphasized the permanent economic function of these Roman urban spaces, which were still in use when European travellers visited these cities. /// (Unicode for Arabic abstract).","archive":"JSTOR","container-title":"Syria","ISSN":"0039-7946","page":"75-154","source":"JSTOR","title":"Le développement urbain de Bosra de l'époque nabatéenne à l'époque byzantine: bilan des recherches françaises 1981-2002","title-short":"Le développement urbain de Bosra de l'époque nabatéenne à l'époque byzantine","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4199419","volume":"79","author":[{"family":"Dentzer","given":"Jean-Marie"},{"family":"Blanc","given":"Pierre-Marie"},{"family":"Fournet","given":"Thibaud"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]}},

New scientific developments are generating a sense of optimism that difficult questions in palaeodemography may, at last, be solved.

  {"id":"Papadopoulos2019","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Following some definitions and etymologies of key terms – archaeology, history, prehistory, protohistory – the purpose of this paper is to review the history of Greek protohistories, chronologically beginning with the earliest writing in the Greek world, in the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 1800 BC). Ironically, this early writing did not lead to a period that anyone would call ‘historic’ or ‘protohistoric’. From there, the author traces the passage of writing through the ‘prehistoric’ period, into the Early Iron Age, and beyond, where we find the first constructions of narrative history. Several early historians will feature prominently in this story: Hekataios, Hellanikos, Herodotos and Thucydides, whose work follows on from that of the earliest Greek alphabetic writing in the eighth century BC in the time of Homer and Hesiod. By so doing, the author’s aim is not just to problematize ‘prehistory’ and ‘protohistory’ as meaningful terms or appropriate categories of analysis, but to suggest that they are, for Greek antiquity, irrelevant.","container-title":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.2019.1568294","ISSN":"0043-8243, 1470-1375","language":"en","page":"1-16","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Greek protohistories","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00438243.2019.1568294","author":[{"family":"Papadopoulos","given":"John K."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,9]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]]},"container-title-short":"World Archaeology"},
  {"id":"Landeschi2018-1","type":"article-journal","abstract":"For over 30 years GIS has been a major theme in archaeology, leading scholars to debate the way geo-spatial platforms can contribute to a better understanding of the ancient landscape and a more thorough interpretation of the archaeological record. Recently, the introduction of more advanced software and hardware solutions have made it possible to use GIS for visualizing and analysing even geometrically complex 3D contents, in a totally unprecedented way. Still, a theoretical debate on the way three-dimensionality could impact GIS-based research has yet to come and only a few pioneering projects have been conducted to show the potential for the discipline. Among the possible lines of enquiry to be developed in this direction, sensory archaeology seems to be one to benefit more from such an approach. Starting from a review of the current state of research this contribution will attempt to show some important results recently obtained in order to generate some insights on theoretical and methodological issues raised by the use of state-of-the-art 3D GIS and to trace new paths for the future.","container-title":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.2018.1463171","ISSN":"0043-8243","issue":"0","page":"1-16","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Rethinking GIS, three-dimensionality and space perception in archaeology","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00438243.2018.1463171","volume":"0","author":[{"family":"Landeschi","given":"Giacomo"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,9]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,4]]}},

  {"id":"Clinton2019","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Background: Given the increasing popularity of reading from screens, it is not surprising that numerous studies have been conducted comparing reading from paper and electronic sources. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to consolidate the findings on reading performance, reading times and calibration of performance (metacognition) between reading text from paper compared to screens. Methods A systematic literature search of reports of studies comparing reading from paper and screens was conducted in seven databases. Additional studies were identified by contacting researchers who have published on the topic, by a backwards search of the references of found reports and by a snowball search of reports citing what was initially found. Only studies that were experiments with random assignment and with participants who had fundamental reading skills and disseminated between 2008 and 2018 were included. Twenty-nine reports with 33 identified studies met inclusion criteria experimentally comparing reading performance (k = 33; n = 2,799), reading time (k = 14; n = 1,233) and/or calibration (k = 11; n = 698) from paper and screens. Results Based on random effects models, reading from screens had a negative effect on reading performance relative to paper (g = −.25). Based on moderator analyses, this may have been limited to expository texts (g = −.32) as there was no difference with narrative texts (g = −.04). The findings were similar when analysing literal and inferential reading performance separately (g = −.33 and g = −.26, respectively). No reliable differences were found for reading time (g = .08). Readers had better calibrated (more accurate) judgement of their performance from paper compared to screens (g = .20). Conclusions Readers may be more efficient and aware of their performance when reading from paper compared to screens.","container-title":"Journal of Research in Reading","DOI":"10.1111/1467-9817.12269","ISSN":"1467-9817","issue":"2","language":"en","page":"288-325","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Reading from paper compared to screens: A systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"Reading from paper compared to screens","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9817.12269","volume":"42","author":[{"family":"Clinton","given":"Virginia"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]}},

There is no credible indication that Augustus or his successors built an extensive sundial, so we must conclude with Schütz that what Pliny described and what the excavations of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) uncovered was a solar meridian line. We then proceed to discuss its significance in the context of the Augustan building programme.

  {"id":"Baiocchi2016","type":"article-journal","abstract":"A lively debate has developed regarding the characteristics of the so-called Horologium Augusti, at first known only through a notice in Pliny and subsequently discovered (at least partly) during the course of excavations begun in 1997 (Leonhardt, in: The Horologium of Augustus: debate and context, 2014). The gnomon of the “Horologium” was composed by the obelisk that presently is nearby in “Piazza Montecitorio” in Rome (Fig. 1). A large part of the debate has centred on the very function of the Horologium, in particular whether it was a true functioning solar clock or simply a sundial. The scope of the present essay concentrates rather on the metrical accuracy that such a sundial could have had; in particular, we will hazard a hypothesis as to the accuracy with which the direction of the sundial was laid out and the possibility of measuring the azimuth in its present placement. Such a detailed geodetic-topographic survey of the portion thus far excavated, could provide useful information for the eventual pursuit of excavations yielding, at the same time, further avenues of research; as an example it would also allow for the deduction of two pieces of information still not entirely established: the exact height of the gnomon, and the exact position of the original placement of the axis of the obelisk.","container-title":"Acta Geodaetica et Geophysica","DOI":"10.1007/s40328-015-0142-4","ISSN":"2213-5812, 2213-5820","issue":"3","language":"en","page":"527-540","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The sundial of Augustus and its survey: unresolved issues and possible solutions","title-short":"The sundial of Augustus and its survey","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40328-015-0142-4","volume":"51","author":[{"family":"Baiocchi","given":"Valerio"},{"family":"Barbarella","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"D’Alessio","given":"Maria Teresa"},{"family":"Lelo","given":"Keti"},{"family":"Troisi","given":"Salvatore"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,26]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9]]},"container-title-short":"Acta Geod Geophys"},

The history of the Etruscans is at the roots of Mediterranean culture and civilization, but their origin is still debated: local or Eastern provenance? To shed light on this mystery, bovine and human mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) have been investigated, based on the well-recognized strict legacy which links human and livestock populations., In the region corresponding to ancient Etruria (Tuscany, Central Italy), several Bos taurus breeds have been reared since historical times. These breeds have a strikingly high level of mtDNA variation, which is found neither in the rest of Italy nor in Europe. The Tuscan bovines are genetically closer to Near Eastern than to European gene pools and this Eastern genetic signature is paralleled in modern human populations from Tuscany, which are genetically close to Anatolian and Middle Eastern ones., The evidence collected corroborates the hypothesis of a common past migration: both humans and cattle reached Etruria from the Eastern Mediterranean area by sea. Hence, the Eastern origin of Etruscans, first claimed by the classic historians Herodotus and Thucydides, receives strong independent support.

After tracing the interpretation of these fragments from antiquity to the present, this article examines the literary, topographical and archaeological evidence for the wall's character and date. Ultimately, the non-archaeological data are inconclusive, and the material evidence seems to affirm an early phase (sixth century BC) focused on individual hilltops, rather than encompassing all hills within a full course. Following this logic, I continue to question the presence of a unified circuit wall at Rome prior to the mid-Republic (fourth century BC). A concluding section reviews the historical circumstances in support of this view.

  {"id":"Santi2014","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The temple of Juno Sospita at Lanuvium (RM) was identified and excavated by the archaeologist A. Pasqui in 1914. Further excavations were carried out between 2006 and 2011, furnishing new and important details of the lay-out of the late-archaic temple. Besides its foundations, already discovered in the previous excavations, trenches and cuttings now confirm the existence of a second row of columns behind the façade and evidence the exact position of the long northern wall and back wall of the building. Using the plans drawn with the first excavation and some old photographs, analysis has focused on a beaten earth floor which was attributed to the late-archaic temple and removed for the most part by Pasqui to continue the researches down to a layer which was wrongly considered virgin soil. A trench in this floor, located in the middle of the Mid-Republican temple cella, was interpreted by A. Galieti as the negative trace of a longitudinal dividing wall of the late-archaic building. Reconstruction of its position, along with the new data, rules out any traditional tripartition of the interior back part of the late-archaic temple as usually supposed for Etruscan-italic temples lay-outs. The only solution would be a temple with two cellae.","archive":"JSTOR","container-title":"Archeologia Classica","ISSN":"0391-8165","page":"103-138","source":"JSTOR","title":"Vecchi e nuovi scavi nel tempio di <i>Iuno Sospita</i> a Lanuvio: Considerazioni sulla pianta del tempio tardo-arcaico","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26234063","volume":"65","author":[{"family":"Santi","given":"Fabrizio"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,15]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]}},

  {"id":"Ovadiah2011","type":"book","abstract":"This work relies on the results of archaeological surveys and excavations of Roman temples, shrines and temene, discovered in Israel. Unfortunately, the literary sources are curiously silent with regard to most of the constructions. Nonetheless, literary sources, archaeological-architectural analogies and circumstantial evidence do provide some additional information for the understanding of their context, architecture, functions and religious-cultic perceptions. Their remains reflect a large scale of sacred buildings or complexes in the Roman period throughout the country, evincing the veneration and worship of many and varied deities of the Graeco-Roman and Oriental pantheons. Many temples and shrines are depicted on coins or mentioned in literary and epigraphic sources. These indicate that a large number of temples/shrines, dedicated to various gods, existed in Israel in the Roman period. Thus, it may be assumed that they reflect not only the architectural reality, but also the religious cultic atmosphere. It would seem that these architectural complexes had either been deliberately concealed and/or destroyed in Late Antiquity (fifth and sixth centuries CE) by order of the Christian authorities and Byzantine emperors, or converted into churches. Some of them were demolished by later generations, natural disasters, fires, conquests, etc. The chronological range of the temples/shrines and temene, discussed in this book, extends over a period of approximately 250 years, from Herod's reign up to Severan era--","ISBN":"978-88-7689-258-5","language":"English","note":"OCLC: 713128934","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Roman temples, shrines and temene in Israel","author":[{"family":"Ovadiah","given":"Asher"},{"family":"Turnheim","given":"Yehudit"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]}},

  {"id":"Tucci2018-1","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This article investigates an aristocratic domus located on the Arx, overlooking the better-known insula of the Aracoeli from the northern summit of the Capitoline hill. This domus was buried during the construction of the basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli in the thirteenth century and remained sealed until the 1980s. I have reconstructed its layout — at least three levels survive — relying on my architectural survey and on the Vittoriano archives. The original phase dates from the first century BC, but substantial restorations were made during the Flavian age, when the domus lost its fauces–atrium–tablinum pattern, and in the early third century AD, when it was expanded vertically by a deep cut into the tuff bank, received a new facade and was redecorated with frescoes. The domus of the Aracoeli must have been a residence of high status, and in the Severan age it was supplied by lead pipes bearing imperial stamps. Although the Capitoline was mostly occupied by public buildings, the Arx was a prestigious neighbourhood and not a sort of monumental acropolis. I discuss the development and the architectural design of the domus of the Aracoeli, including its underground residential spaces as well as its sculptural and painted decoration; finally, I examine the remodellings of the original atrium house from a socio-cultural point of view.\n\nIl presente articolo ha come oggetto una domus aristocratica situata sull'Arx, la parte settentrionale del Campidoglio, al di sopra della meglio conosciuta insula dell'Aracoeli. La domus fu interrata durante la costruzione della basilica di Santa Maria in Aracoeli nel XIII secolo e fu riscoperta intorno al 1980. E’ stato possibile ricostruire i suoi tre piani inferiori grazie al rilievo delle strutture superstiti, integrato con alcuni disegni dell'archivio del Vittoriano. La fase originaria risale al I secolo a.C. ma restauri consistenti furono effettuati durante l'età flavia, quando la domus perse lo schema assiale fauces-atrium-tablinum ; all'inizio del III secolo d.C. fu ampliata intaccando il banco di tufo sottostante, venne dotata di una nuova facciata, e fu decorata con affeschi. La domus dell'Aracoeli era certamente una dimora di alto rango e tubi di piombo con bolli imperiali garantivano il rifornimento di acqua in età severiana. Sebbene il Campidoglio fosse occupato soprattutto da edifici pubblici, è evidente che l'Arx era una zona residenziale prestigiosa piuttosto che un'acropoli monumentale. L'articolo analizza le fasi e l'architettura della domus dell'Aracoeli, compresi i suoi ambienti residenziali sotterranei e la sua decorazione scultorea e pittorica, anche da un punto di vista socio-culturale.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.1017/S0068246218000351","ISSN":"0068-2462, 2045-239X","language":"en","page":"1-74","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Living on the Capitoline Hill: The <i>Domus</i> of the Aracoeli and its sculptural and painted decoration","title-short":"LIVING ON THE CAPITOLINE HILL","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0068246218000351/type/journal_article","author":[{"family":"Tucci","given":"Pier Luigi"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,22]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,18]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},

The original has often been attributed to the Greek sculptor Skopas of Paros. A closer examination of this Apollo's iconography and stylistic peculiarities makes it clear that the original statue was an early Augustan classicizing work. The image of Apollo on the Sorrento Base, freed from any literary associations and analyzed as an independent statue type, is found to be late Hellenistic in style and Roman in concept.

This article presents the intellectual history of classical archaeology in one part of this vast Russo-Soviet sphere, the South Caucasus. Although sharing a common historical framework with the discipline as practiced in the West, classical archaeology in the South Caucasus was founded and developed on rather different grounds. This paper probes the beginnings, and subsequent institutionalization, of antichnaia arkheologiia, or \"ancient\" archaeology, from the 19th century until the present, providing a regional account in the decades before World War II, followed by a more focused analysis of developments in the Republic of Armenia in the subsequent decades. The purpose of this historical anthropology of the discipline is twofold: to detail the workings of an archaeological tradition in a part of the world that, since the collapse of the Iron Curtain, increasingly has become an area of interest to Western scholars; and to denormalize our own disciplinary culture and consider what (if any) lessons might be learned from a classical tradition alternative to the one in which Western scholars have been enculturated.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","DOI":"10.3764/aja.112.2.247","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"2","page":"247-278","source":"JSTOR","title":"Making Nations from the Ground up: Traditions of Classical Archaeology in the South Caucasus","title-short":"Making Nations from the Ground up","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20627449","volume":"112","author":[{"family":"Khatchadourian","given":"Lori"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,28]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

However, the rear wall of the building, without entrances, belies this reconstruction and supports identification as Republican shipsheds. The missing letters of the preliminary inscription on fragment 24 b of the Forma Urbis are of limited relevance and do not justify the rebuttal (based also on a number of misunderstandings) of identification as navalia. It is likely that the actual porticus Aemilia, one of the several porticoes built in the first half of the second century BC, was simply a porticoed street, located between the Forum Boarium and the Tiber.","container-title":"Archeologia Classica","note":"P.

  {"id":"Burgers2015","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This article presents the preliminary results of excavations carried out between 2011 and 2013 among the standing remains of the building commonly identified as the Porticus Aemilia, centrally located in the ancient river harbour of Rome. The common identification of this building as a warehouse has recently been questioned by another school of thought, which contends that it was the Urbs' Navalia or shipshed. The excavations allow us to conclude that such one-sided interpretations fail to do justice to the archaeological evidence, which suggests instead a highly differentiated history of occupation in the area. Although the original use of the building in the late Republican era remains obscure as yet, we have documented multiple traces of abandonment, collapse, rebuilding and restructuring for the various post-Republican phases. The excavations are particularly revealing with regard to the late first and early 2nd century AD, when parts of the building were restructured to accommodate horrea. The new data constitute the first scientifically excavated evidence of the existence of horrea in the Urbs.","container-title":"Babesch","DOI":"10.2143/BAB.90.0.3089920","ISSN":"1783-1369","issue":"0","page":"199–212","source":"mEDRA","title":"The Imperial horrea of the Porticus Aemilia","URL":"http://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=article&id=3089920&journal_code=BAB","author":[{"family":"Burgers","given":"Gert-Jan"},{"family":"Kok-Merlino","given":"Raphaëlle-Anne"},{"family":"Sebastiani","given":"Renato"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,1]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]}},

  {"id":"Camerlenghi2019","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Though Rome has a long history of domed constructions, not one dome was built in that city during a one-thousand-year period—roughly between the mid-fifth and the mid-fifteenth century. How can we explain such a gap and what is implied by this absence? This paper begins by asking why dome construction in Rome stopped after the mid-fifth century. Typological, political, ideological, and possibly technical reasons lie at the root of this rupture, which itself urges a reevaluation of the significance and function of domes across time, and of the cultural context that allowed for their demise. A second question is then posed about why Romans were slow to return to dome construction after the form blossomed elsewhere on the Italian peninsula between the eleventh and early fifteenth centuries. This delayed reappearance discloses distinct attitudes toward domes and suggests Romans lacked the desire to build them; indeed, they were quite content with the alternative solutions they had developed in the intervening centuries, chief among which were thin-walled basilicas and their mosaic-encrusted half-dome apses. All told, Rome’s millennial gap in dome construction invites us to reconsider longstanding historiographical assumptions about medieval architecture.","container-title":"Gesta","DOI":"10.1086/704636","ISSN":"0016-920X","issue":"2","page":"103-135","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"The Millennial Gap in Dome Construction in Rome","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/704636","volume":"58","author":[{"family":"Camerlenghi","given":"Nicola"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,28]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,1]]},"container-title-short":"Gesta"},

  {"id":"Marvin1983","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Of the great Imperial Thermae in Rome, the possibility exists of reconstructing the sculptural program of only one-the Baths of Caracalla. The major social role played by baths in Roman life and the importance of the capital in influencing institutions in the provinces make such an attempt worthwhile. Since the Baths of Caracalla have always remained standing, the removal of their decorations began early, and many legends and misapprehensions confuse the picture of what was actually found there. The methodology followed here has been to accept as authentic only those works which can be traced to a known excavation. Once a list of sculptures attributable to the baths is compiled, the evidence from the works themselves is combined with the evidence from the architectural design of the complex to find clues to their placement within the Thermae. Specific locations for many works are suggested, and general ones for almost all. Moreover, a close analysis of the sculptures in their architectural setting reveals a group of monumental works which seem to have been commissioned with the bath and to exemplify \"Severan Baroque\" in an unexpected and dramatic way. In addition, the study gives a new glimpse of the civic institutions and public taste of Early Christian Rome, since the sculptures retrievable today are those which were in place in Late Antiquity.

  {"id":"Mari2007","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Recent excavations at Hadrian's Villa have revealed the remains of a structure with a large exedra, numerous architectural elements, and some sculptural fragments in the Egyptian style. The characteristics of some of the finds immediately brought to mind Hadrian's connections with Egypt, the long-standing \"Egyptian problem\" in studies of the villa (e.g., the Canopus-Serapeum), and naturally, Antinous. In this article, we examine specific aspects of the structure and identify it as the Antinoeion, based, in part, on a masonry foundation that may be connected to the famous obelisk of Antinous at Rome. We also present, for the first time, an architectural reconstruction of the building. We argue that the Antinoeion is not simply a mausoleum or cenotaph and temple where the cult of the dead youth Antinous, who was assimilated to Osiris, could be associated with that of other Egyptian divinities. Rather, it is a true tomb housing the remains of Antinous. It is here suggested that this tomb was built so that Hadrian could commemorate his paramour to whom he was joined by a deeply passionate and spiritual bond.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"1","page":"83-104","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Antinoeion of Hadrian's Villa: Interpretation and Architectural Reconstruction","title-short":"The Antinoeion of Hadrian's Villa","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40024582","volume":"111","author":[{"family":"Mari","given":"Zaccaria"},{"family":"Sgalambro","given":"Sergio"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,1]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"container-title-short":"AJA"},

Some very long-standing beliefs about the location and nature of the horti Maecenatiani are shown to be unfounded; on the other hand, close reading of an unjustly neglected text provides some new and unexpected evidence for what they were used for. The main focus of the argument is on the relevance of the horti to the development of Roman performance culture. It is intended to contribute to the understanding of Roman social history, and the method used is traditionally empirical: to collect and present whatever evidence is available, to define as precisely as possible what that evidence implies, and to formulate a hypothesis consistent with those implications.\n, \nSull'onda del fondamentale lavoro di Chrystina Häuber sul settore orientale del mons Oppius, questo articolo offre un completo riesame delle testimonianze relative ai ‘giardini di Mecenate’.

  {"id":"Carroll2019","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This study explores social and gendered aspects of female fertility in popular religious practices in Italy in the last four centuries BC, and it investigates the role of supplication and votive dedications in promoting maternal health and family continuity. It tackles modern assumptions which have strongly aligned the religious activities of women in Republican Italy with their generative interests and specific ‘fertility cults’ or ‘women's goddesses’. Divinities associated with fertility are explored here, with particular emphasis on Mater Matuta who is often defined in modern research as a ‘mother goddess’. The study shows that cults purely concerned with fertility are unlikely to have existed. Fertility was only one of several fundamental personal concerns brought by women and men to the generalist and polyvalent deities of Republican Italy. Items associated with fertility, such as terracotta wombs, male and female genitals, and swaddled infants, always occur together with other anatomical ex-votos across a wide range of sites and were dedicated to many deities. Considering the archaeological and textual evidence, Mater Matuta can be shown to have occupied a more flexible and encompassing space in the pantheon, and her involvement in marriage, motherhood and childbearing was part of a wider repertoire of responsibilities. The study also focuses attention on a distinctive, but largely overlooked, votive assemblage from Capua which includes numerous tufa statues of women and babies. The paper proposes that they should be understood as votive objects offered to an unknown deity by Capuan women as thanks for support in the generative enterprise, personally and more broadly in the context of the city's religious and civic identity., Il presente studio esplora aspetti sociali e di genere relativi alla sfera della fertilità femminile nelle pratiche della religiosità popolare in Italia negli ultimi quattro secoli precedenti la nascita di Cristo e indaga inoltre il ruolo della supplica e delle dediche votive nel sostenere la salute materna e la continuità familiare. Si confronta inoltre con l'assunto moderno che ha fortemente identificato le attività religiose femminili nell'Italia repubblicana con l'aspetto generativo e con specifici culti legati alla fertilità o con divinità pertinenti alle donne. Vengono pertanto esplorate nel presente contributo divinità associate alla fertilità, con particolare riguardo a Mater Matuta che è spesso definita nella ricerca moderna come ‘dea madre’. Lo studio dimostra che è improbabile che siano esistiti culti legati alla sola sfera della fertilità. La fertilità era solo una delle numerose preoccupazioni personali presentate da donne e uomini a divinità ‘generaliste’ e polivalenti dell'Italia repubblicana. Infatti oggetti associati con la fertilità, come ad esempio gli uteri in terracotta, i genitali maschili e femminili, e i bambini in fasce, sono sempre associati con altri ex-voto anatomici in un'ampia gamma di siti ed erano dedicati a molte divinità. Considerando l'evidenza archeologica e testuale, è dunque plausibile ipotizzare che Mater Matuta abbia occupato uno spazio più flessibile e articolato nel pantheon e che il suo coinvolgimento nel matrimonio, nella maternità e nella gravidanza fosse parte di un più ampio repertorio di pertinenze. Lo studio focalizza l'attenzione anche su un caratteristico insieme di testimonianze votive da Capua, caratteristico, ma per lo più trascurato, che comprende numerose statue in tufo di donne e bambini. L'articolo propone di interpretarle come oggetti votivi offerti ad una divinità per noi sconosciuta da donne di Capua come ringraziamento per l'aiuto ricevuto nell'impresa generativa, personalmente e più in generale nel contesto dell'identità religiosa e civica della città.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.1017/S0068246218000399","ISSN":"0068-2462, 2045-239X","language":"en","page":"1-45","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Mater Matuta, ‘fertility cults’ and the integration of women in religious life in Italy in the fourth to first centuries BC","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/papers-of-the-british-school-at-rome/article/mater-matuta-fertility-cults-and-the-integration-of-women-in-religious-life-in-italy-in-the-fourth-to-first-centuries-bc/F4DD5E39F45CDA0375179B0DE1B01FD3","volume":"87","author":[{"family":"Carroll","given":"Maureen"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},

  {"id":"Bultrighini2018","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper discusses two scanty but complex groups of sources which seem to suggest that Thursday (dies Iovis, that is, Jupiter's Day in the Roman planetary seven-day week) was a day of rest in honour of Jupiter during the later imperial period: a number of ecclesiastical texts from late antique Gaul and Galicia, and three documentary papyri from Oxyrhynchus. The former imply that an unofficial observance of Jupiter's Day, as opposed to the Christian Lord's Day (Sunday), persisted among the populace despite Church opposition to such deviant behaviour. The latter hint at Thursday being a non-working day for official bureaux during the third and early fourth centuries, before the formalization of Sunday as an official day of rest by Constantine in 321. The paper concludes with reflections on the idea that during the later imperial period — as the use of the planetary week became increasingly popular — Thursday became the most important and sacred day in the Roman seven-day week by reason of being the day dedicated to the chief god of the Roman pantheon and, at the same time, the day associated with the astrologically favourable planet that had been named after Jupiter. If Thursday was ever a day of rest recurring on a hebdomadal basis during the later Roman Empire, it was presumably the Judaeo-Christian tradition of the Sabbath and the Lord's Day that provided pagans with the notion of a weekly feast day., Il presente contributo tratta di due non particolarmente consistenti ma complessi gruppi di fonti: una serie di testi ecclesiastici dalla Gallia e dalla Galizia tardo antiche e tre papiri da Ossirinco, che sembrano suggerire come il Giovedì (dies Iovis, ovverosia il giorno di Giove nella settimana romana planetaria di sette giorni) nel tardo periodo imperiale fosse un giorno di riposo in onore di Giove. I primi suggeriscono che un'osservanza non ufficiale del Giorno di Giove, contrapposto al cristiano giorno del Signore (Domenica), persisteva tra la popolazione nonostante l'opposizione della Chiesa a questo comportamento deviante. I secondi accennano al fatto che il giovedì fosse un giorno non lavorativo per gli uffici/esercizi pubblici durante il III e gli inizi del IV sec., prima della formalizzazione della domenica come giorno ufficiale di riposo da parte di Costantino nel 321. L'articolo si conclude con alcune riflessioni sull'idea che durante il tardo periodo imperiale — nel momento in cui l'uso della settimana planetaria acquisì sempre maggiore popolarità — il giovedì divenne il giorno più importante e sacro nella settimana romana di sette giorni in virtù del fatto che era dedicato alla divinità principale del pantheon romano e che, allo stesso tempo, il giorno era associato al pianeta astrologicamente propizio che prendeva il nome da Giove. Se il giovedì è stato un giorno di riposo ricorrente su base settimanale durante il tardo impero, è presumibilmente la tradizione Giudeo-Cristiana del Sabbath e del giorno del Signore che ha fornito ai pagani la nozione di un giorno di festività settimanale.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.1017/S0068246217000356","ISSN":"0068-2462, 2045-239X","language":"en","page":"61-84","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Thursday (Dies Iovis) in the later Roman Empire","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/papers-of-the-british-school-at-rome/article/thursday-dies-iovis-in-the-later-roman-empire/762662203AE6A5DB8D486D7D8D964BD6","volume":"86","author":[{"family":"Bultrighini","given":"Ilaria"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},
  {"id":"Vukovic2018-1","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The Lupercalia is one of the most important and most controversial of Roman festivals. This paper addresses the issue of its topography, which has received renewed attention in recent years. It is divided into two main sections, the first discussing the hotly debated location of the Lupercal cave, and the second the course of the running Luperci. The former section reviews the literary and archaeological evidence for the location of the cave, discusses its significance as a unique religious site, and calls for further investigation in the area of the southwest Palatine. The second section seeks to challenge the most influential theories on the course of the Luperci by carefully examining the ancient evidence and the terminology it uses. A contextualization of the sources and the topographic elements they describe shows that many modern theories contain serious flaws when it comes to this subject. Most modern interpretations rely on a passage of Augustine which is very problematic because of his biased interpretatio Christiana. The conclusion is that the festival’s typology as a ritual of lustration is key to understanding the course of the Luperci., I lupercalia sono una delle più importanti e controverse festività romane. Il presente articolo affronta la questione della loro topografia, che ha ricevuto rinnovata attenzione in anni recenti.

La prima sezione esamina l'evidenza letteraria e archeologica inerente la localizzazione della grotta, discute il suo significato come sito religioso di eccezionale rilevanza e richiama la necessità di ulteriori indagini nell'area sud-occidentale del Palatino. La seconda sezione tenta di testare la validità delle più influenti teorie sul percorso dei luperci attraverso un esame attento delle fonti antiche e della terminologia utilizzata nelle stesse. La contestualizzazione delle fonti e degli elementi topografici che descrivono mostra come molte teorie moderne su questo argomento abbiano seri difetti. La maggior parte delle interpretazioni moderne si basa infatti su un passaggio di Agostino che è molto problematico per via della sua interpretatio Christiana. La conclusione è che la chiave per la comprensione del percorso dei luperci risiede nella tipologia della festività che è un rituale di lustratio.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.1017/S0068246217000381","ISSN":"0068-2462, 2045-239X","language":"en","page":"37-60","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Topography of the Lupercalia","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/papers-of-the-british-school-at-rome/article/topography-of-the-lupercalia/91F6642CFE4C0303D50E9F604F7EA3E4","volume":"86","author":[{"family":"Vuković","given":"Krešimir"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},

  {"id":"Ceccarelli2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The object of study in this paper is four unpublished kilns excavated in 2012 at Montelabate (Perugia, Italy), in the framework of the Montelabate Project. The workshop, in use from the mid-first to the fifth century AD, which produced amphorae, coarseware and tile, offers an interesting model for the study of the economy of production in Regio VI (Umbria). The location of the workshop allows the exploration of wider issues such as connectivity, changes in local and regional markets, and continuity in the exploitation of natural resources: the site had a rich clay deposit and was surrounded by densely forested hills, whilst the flat fertile fields were suitable for agriculture and wine production; connectivity was ensured by the river Ventia, a tributary of the Tiber, and by an internal road that joined the Via Flaminia. The paper discusses the substantial number of failed flat-bottomed wine amphorae of the Spello type, discovered at Montelabate, that revealed a large-scale production with little standardization, as eight different local types were identified. The manufacturing complex provides new evidence for a production system that played an important role on a larger regional scale as well as in the local economic network, which continued until the fifth century AD.\n, \nIl presente contributo si focalizza sullo studio di un'area produttiva, composta da quattro fornaci rettangolari verticali, scavata per la prima volta nel 2012 a Montelabate (Perugia, Italia). La produzione, che comprendeva sia anfore che ceramica comune e laterizi, rappresenta un importante tassello per lo studio del quadro economico e produttivo della Regio VI (Umbria) tra la metà del I secolo ed il IV–V secolo d.C. La posizione geografica dell'officina permette di analizzare diversi aspetti quali i collegamenti e gli scambi commerciali, i cambiamenti del mercato sia locale che regionale e la continuità dello sfruttamento delle risorse naturali: le fornaci erano costruite accanto ad una cava di argilla ideale per la produzione ceramica, mentre il combustibile era fornito dalle colline coperte di boschi. Infine, lo sfruttamento agricolo con la coltivazione della vite si concentrava nelle aree pianeggianti collegate dal fiume Ventia, affluente del Tevere, mentre il collegamento terrestre era garantito dalla via Flaminia. L'analisi dei numerosi scarti presentati in dettaglio in questo contributo indica una prima fase di produzione che riguardava principalmente anfore vinarie a fondo piatto c.d. tippo di Spello, di cui sono stati individuati otto tipi. L'officina di Montelabate, pur in maniera ridotta, ha continuato a produrre ceramica comune e laterizi fino al IV–V secolo d.C, rappresentando un'importante testimonianza produttiva di epoca tardo-antica sia a livello locale che regionale.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.1017/S0068246217000058","ISSN":"0068-2462, 2045-239X","language":"en","page":"109-141","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Production and trade in Central Italy in the Roman period: The Amphora workshop of Montelabate in Umbria","title-short":"PRODUCTION AND TRADE IN CENTRAL ITALY IN THE ROMAN PERIOD","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/papers-of-the-british-school-at-rome/article/production-and-trade-in-central-italy-in-the-roman-period-the-amphora-workshop-of-montelabate-in-umbria/E83BA8AE20ABA630B8FACBB5B7F03F84","volume":"85","author":[{"family":"Ceccarelli","given":"Letizia"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},
  {"id":"Donkin2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Rome's man-made mounds occupy a position between built antiquities and natural features. In the Middle Ages and early modern period, particular attention was paid to Monte Testaccio, the Mausoleum of Augustus, and the related ‘mons omnis terra’. Debate focused on the origins and composition of the mounds, thought to contain either earth brought to Rome as symbolic tribute, pottery used to hold monetary tribute, or pottery produced locally. Developing over time in different genres of writing on the city, these interpretations were also employed in works on historical, religious and geological themes. The importation of material, expressive of relations between Rome and the wider world in antiquity, was used to draw positive and negative comparisons with present-day rulers and the papacy, and to associate Rome with Babylon. The growth of the mounds and the presence of ceramics were invoked in discussions of the formation of mountains and montane fossils. If the mounds' ambiguities facilitated their incorporation into other debates, the terms in which they are discussed reflect ongoing engagement with literature on the city. The reception of these monuments thus offers a distinctive perspective on the significance of Rome to connections between spheres of knowledge in this period.\n, \nA Roma le colline artificiali, frutto dell'azione umana, possono essere considerate una sorta di via di mezzo tra antichità costruite e realtà naturali. Nel Medioevo e nel periodo moderno particolare attenzione è stata data al Monte Testaccio, al Mausoleo di Augusto e al relativo ‘mons omnis terra’. In particolare il dibattito si è focalizzato sulle origini e sulla composizione di questi rilievi. Si è pensato che contenessero o terra portata a Roma come un tributo simbolico, o ceramiche utilizzate per contenere tributi monetari, o ceramiche prodotte localmente. Sviluppandosi nel corso del tempo in relazione a diversi tipi di scritti sulla città, queste interpretazioni sono state utilizzate anche in lavori su tematiche storiche, religiose e geologiche. L'importazione di materiale, espressione delle relazioni ad ampio raggio di Roma nel mondo antico, è stata usata per tracciare confronti in positivo o in negativo con governanti contemporanei e il papato, e per associare Roma con Babilonia. La ‘crescita’ di queste colline artificiali e la presenza di ceramiche sono state chiamate in causa nelle discussioni sulla formazione di montagne e fossili montani. Se l'ambiguità di queste strutture ha facilitato il loro inserimento in altri dibattiti, i termini nei quali sono state discusse riflettono tuttavia anche il continuo interesse nei confronti di Roma. La ricezione di questi monumenti perciò offre una prospettiva peculiare del significato di Roma con connessioni tra diverse sfere di conoscenza.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.1017/S0068246217000022","ISSN":"0068-2462, 2045-239X","language":"en","page":"171-204","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"‘Mons manufactus’: Rome's man-made mountains between history and natural history (c. 1100–1700)","title-short":"‘MONS MANUFACTUS’","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/papers-of-the-british-school-at-rome/article/mons-manufactus-romes-manmade-mountains-between-history-and-natural-history-c-11001700/7B3E454915592A54F58E5D566CB82A7C","volume":"85","author":[{"family":"Donkin","given":"Lucy"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},
  {"id":"FitzPatrick2017","type":"article-journal","abstract":"This paper presents the findings of a survey of the funerary monuments and burial vault of an exiled community of Gaelic Irish who were interred (1608–23) at San Pietro in Montorio, Rome. The site of their burial and commemoration had an eventful history that resulted in loss, fragmentation and alteration of the ledgers of élite members of the group, including those of the respective chiefs and earls of the Ulster lordships of Tyrone and Tyrconnell in Ireland. The original form and layout of the ledgers and their inscriptions is proposed and they are examined in the context of their setting in a Franciscan church patronized by Philip III of Spain. The ledger inscriptions commemorate both the suffering and Counter-Reformation confessional identity of the Gaelic Irish as Catholic exiles. They indicate tension between the complex political circumstances of the exiles’ lives in Rome and a concern to provide an appropriate burial site publicly reflecting their status and piety.\n, \nL'articolo presenta gli esiti di un'indagine sui monumenti funerari e sulla cripta di una comunità gaelica irlandese in esilio, i cui membri furono sepolti a San Pietro in Montorio a Roma tra il 1608 e il 1623. Il luogo della loro sepoltura e della loro commemorazione è stato caratterizzato da una storia densa di avvenimenti che ha avuto come esito la perdita, la frammentazione e l'alterazione delle pietre tombali dei membri dell’élite del gruppo, inclusi quelle dei rispettivi capi e conti delle signorie dell'Ulster di Tyrone e Tyrconnell in Irlanda. Nell'articolo si propone la ricostruzione della forma e dell'impostazione originale delle pietre tombali e delle iscrizioni, che vengono esaminate nel contesto della loro ambientazione in una chiesa francescana, di cui Filippo III di Spagna era finanziatore. Le iscrizioni delle pietre tombali commemorano sia la sofferenza sia l'identità confessionale dei Gaelici Irlandesi, esuli cattolici nell'epoca della controriforma. Esse testimoniano inoltre la tensione tra le complesse circostanze politiche delle vite degli esiliati in Roma e la preoccupazione di fornire un luogo di sepoltura appropriato che rispecchiasse anche pubblicamente il loro status e la loro devozione.","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","DOI":"10.1017/S006824621700006X","ISSN":"0068-2462, 2045-239X","language":"en","page":"205-239","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Exilic burial place of a Gaelic Irish community at San Pietro in Montorio, Rome","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/papers-of-the-british-school-at-rome/article/exilic-burial-place-of-a-gaelic-irish-community-at-san-pietro-in-montorio-rome/8994F8251D9ACF82312F0EF7D0E9C96C","volume":"85","author":[{"family":"FitzPatrick","given":"Elizabeth"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,2]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10]]},"container-title-short":"PBSR"},

  {"id":"Mari2007-1","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Recent excavations at Hadrian's Villa have revealed the remains of a structure with a large exedra, numerous architectural elements, and some sculptural fragments in the Egyptian style. The characteristics of some of the finds immediately brought to mind Hadrian's connections with Egypt, the long-standing \"Egyptian problem\" in studies of the villa (e.g., the Canopus-Serapeum), and naturally, Antinous. In this article, we examine specific aspects of the structure and identify it as the Antinoeion, based, in part, on a masonry foundation that may be connected to the famous obelisk of Antinous at Rome. We also present, for the first time, an architectural reconstruction of the building. We argue that the Antinoeion is not simply a mausoleum or cenotaph and temple where the cult of the dead youth Antinous, who was assimilated to Osiris, could be associated with that of other Egyptian divinities. Rather, it is a true tomb housing the remains of Antinous. It is here suggested that this tomb was built so that Hadrian could commemorate his paramour to whom he was joined by a deeply passionate and spiritual bond.","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"1","page":"83-104","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Antinoeion of Hadrian's Villa: Interpretation and Architectural Reconstruction","title-short":"The Antinoeion of Hadrian's Villa","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40024582","volume":"111","author":[{"family":"Mari","given":"Zaccaria"},{"family":"Sgalambro","given":"Sergio"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,3]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]}},

  {"id":"DeFeo2007","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the historical development of the Augustan Aqueduct Serino-Naples-Miseno in the Campania Region, in Southern Italy. The Serino aqueduct is not well known because there are no remains of spectacular bridges, but it was a masterpiece of engineering and one of the largest aqueduct systems in the whole Roman Empire. The Serino aqueduct was constructed during the Augustus period of the Roman Empire, probably between 33 and 12 BC when Marcus Vipsanius\nAgrippa was curator aquarum in Rome, principally in order to refurnish the Roman fleet of Misenum and secondarily to supply water for the increasing demand of the important commercial harbour of Puteoli as\nwell as drinking water for big cities such as Cumae and Neapolis. The main channel of the Serino aqueduct\nwas approximately 96 km long, and had 7 main branches to towns along its trace such as Nola, Pompeii,\nAcerra, Herculaneum, Atella, Pausillipon, Nisida, Puteoli, Cumae and Baiae. Since the total length of all the\nbranches was approximately 49 km, the Serino aqueduct complex had a length of around 145 km and\ntherefore it should be considered the largest aqueduct system in the Roman world.","container-title":"Water Science & Technology Water Supply","DOI":"10.2166/ws.2007.015","page":"131-138","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Historical development of the Augustan Aqueduct in Southern Italy: Twenty centuries of works from Serino to Naples","title-short":"Historical development of the Augustan Aqueduct in Southern Italy","volume":"7","author":[{"family":"De Feo","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Napoli","given":"R.M.A"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,3,1]]},"container-title-short":"Water Science & Technology Water Supply"},
  {"id":"Bodel2019","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The rediscovery in the summer of 2017 of a large monumental tomb of unusual form outside the Stabian Gate at Pompeii caused an immediate sensation, and the swift initial publication by M. Osanna in JRA 31 (2018) of the long funerary inscription fronting the W side of the base, facing the road, has been welcomed gratefully by the scholarly community. The text — at 183 words, by far the longest funerary inscription yet found at Pompeii — records a series of extraordinary benefactions by an unnamed local worthy, beginning with a banquet held on the occasion of his coming-of-age ceremony and continuing, it seems, well into his adult life, up to the final years of the town when the monument was built. As Osanna and others have recognized, the inscription, which seems to allude to an historical event (Tac., Ann. 14.17), the riot between Nucerians and Pompeians around Pompeii’s amphitheater in A.D. 59, provides valuable if ambivalent new information relevant to the demographic, economic and social history of Pompeii that will require full discussion in a variety of contexts over time. The present collection of remarks, a collaborative effort, is offered in the spirit of debate and is intended as an interim contribution toward a more complete understanding of the text.1","container-title":"Journal of Roman Archaeology","DOI":"10.1017/S1047759419000096","ISSN":"1047-7594, 2331-5709","language":"en","page":"148-182","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Notes on the elogium of a benefactor at Pompeii","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman-archaeology/article/notes-on-the-elogium-of-a-benefactor-at-pompeii/D81465F4C8FB7298950682143FB2585D#","volume":"32","author":[{"family":"Bodel","given":"John"},{"family":"Bendlin","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Bernard","given":"Seth"},{"family":"Bruun","given":"Christer"},{"family":"Edmondson","given":"Jonathan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,4]]},"issued":{"literal":"2019/ed"},"container-title-short":"JRA"},
  {"id":"Osanna2018","type":"article-journal","abstract":"A monumental tomb has been discovered at Pompeii in the Stabian Gate area during renovation work on a public building, constructed in the early 19th c., that currently houses the offices of the Archaeological Park. The tomb is part of a necropolis that developed alongside an important gate in the S sector of the city walls. In this area, 19th-c. investigations brought to light the gate as well as a section of paved road and two schola tombs in grey tuff, set directly on the left side of those leaving the city, on public ground and therefore authorised by the ordo decurionum (fig, 1). The first of the tombs is that of Marcus Tullius, a prominent figure in Pompeian society known for the dedication of the Temple of Fortuna Augusta; the second belongs to the duumvir Marcus Alleius Minius. Research was first conducted here by A. Maiuri, then again in the period 2001-2 when an additional stretch of paved road and two tombs on its right side were brought to light. The new, ongoing excavation, launched in 2016 to consolidate the foundations of the 19th-c. building but complicated by that building's looming presence, led to the rediscovery of a monumental tomb which had actually been found, partially excavated and robbed at the moment of the construction of the 19th-c. building.","container-title":"Journal of Roman Archaeology","DOI":"10.1017/S1047759418001460","ISSN":"1047-7594, 2331-5709","language":"en","page":"310-322","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Games, banquets, handouts, and the population of Pompeii as deduced from a new tomb inscription","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman-archaeology/article/games-banquets-handouts-and-the-population-of-pompeii-as-deduced-from-a-new-tomb-inscription/29B49DE6F95630C4BC00FE2DA3F69675","volume":"31","author":[{"family":"Osanna","given":"Massimo"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,4]]},"issued":{"literal":"2018/ed"}},

First, we address how much Greek is found, where it appears, and what was being written in Greek.

Finally, we examine Greek graffiti in context and discuss two locations in Herculaneum where the graffiti have survived and are still visible in situ. By presenting where Greek graffiti appear, what they contain, and how they communicate and interact with other texts, we aim to provide a more comprehensive picture of the distribution and context of Greek in Herculaneum and to offer new insights into the culture of writing in Campania.

  {"id":"Agrturk2018","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Ancient Nicomedia, the most important capital of the eastern Roman empire during the Tetrarchy, now lies below the modern industrial city of İzmit. The first systematic archaeological research on Diocletian's capital, supported with a grant from The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TüBİTAK), examines a series of monumental reliefs and statues from a terraced imperial cult complex, found in the Çukurbağr district at the heart of modern İzmit. Excavations have brought to light more than 30 relief panels (average ht. 1.0 m x wdth. 1.5 m), the only surviving examples of Late Roman state reliefs that have extensive paint preserved on them. The panels illuminate multiple aspects of the art of the period, including the brightly colored costumes and the new and distinctive self-representation of the tetrarchic emperors and their administration. In this article, one of these relief panels, with a representation of two emperors embracing, is discussed as the precursor to the well-known porphyry Tetrarchs from Venice and the Vatican. It is argued that the relief panel is part of a larger adventus scene that shows the meeting of the two diarchs, Diocletian and Maximian, and thus dates from slightly before the onset of Tetrarchy in 293 C.E.

  {"id":"Ricci1997","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Il frammento c della lacunosa iscrizione romana CIL VI 31619 è stato identificato in un frustolo epigrafico che attualmente si conserva nel cortile del palazzo Medici-Riccardi di Firenze. Il testo presenta diversi elementi d'interesse, ma anche gravi problemi interpretativi. In esso infatti si fa riferimento ad un personaggio, [------]elius Lartis f., che sembra aver venduto (o appaltato o affittato?) l'ager Ciminius (o una parte di esso), ricavandone del denaro, mirando in tal modo a costituire un complesso di entrate a favore di un destinatario che purtroppo rimane sconosciuto. Nel presente contributo si cerca di chiarire, fin dove appare possibile, i punti oscuri di tale presunta ricostruzione : in primo luogo, la localizzazione dell'agro Ciminio, in connessione con le vicende romano-etrusche della fine del IV sec. a.C; quindi il calcolo della ingente somma ricavata dall'operazione sopra accennata e computata in aes grave; la natura delle operazioni descritte e dei vectigalia menzionati; e infine, il carattere dell'iscrizione e la possibile identità del suo protagonista, di origine etrusca o falisca. In base agli indizi raccolti (relativi ai caratteri paleografici e alla disposizione del testo, al materiale e al trattamento della superficie del supporto) e ai confronti effettuati, di cui si dira tra poco, l'iscrizione sembra appartenere con ogni verisimiglianza agli inizi del I secolo d.C. Non sembre improbabile allora che il documenta, che ricorda fatti storici anteriori, sia stato realizzato a distanza di secoli per celebrare un uomo illustre del passato sulla falsariga degli elogia augustei del Foro Romano e del Foro di Augusto, che la struttura del testo ricorda tra l'altro da vicino. Tale operazione potrebbe spiegarsi nel clima di generale recupero di antiche tradizioni gentilizie che appare documentato, nella prima età imperiale, in diverse città dell'Etruria. A tal scopo, il confronto più calzante appare quello con la serie epigrafica degli elogia degli Spurinnae tarquiniesi.","container-title":"Mélanges de l'école française de Rome","DOI":"10.3406/mefr.1997.1997","issue":"2","language":"ita","page":"503-512","source":"www.persee.fr","title":"CIL VI 31619: frammento di un elogio dell'Etruria meridionale?","title-short":"CIL VI 31619","URL":"https://www.persee.fr/doc/mefr_0223-5102_1997_num_109_2_1997","volume":"109","author":[{"family":"Ricci","given":"Cecilia"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,30]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1997]]},"container-title-short":"MEFRA"},

By combining our knowledge of both new and previously published archive files we can now make a reconstructive hypothesis focusing on the architectural structure of the sepulchre itself, generally considered of the chamber kind. The tomb probably had a monumental facade constituted by an exedra and a precinct placed in the back side. The paintings, which framed the main side of the exedra as well as the lateral ones (therefore the external side of the building), depict a scene of triumph along with a battle representation which most likely allude to a triumph reported by the tomb's owner, perhaps a praetor from the second century B.C.","archive":"JSTOR","container-title":"Archeologia Classica","ISSN":"0391-8165","page":"75-107","source":"JSTOR","title":"Il Sepolcro cd.

Classicists generally assume that the modern idea of sacrifice as the ritual killing of an animal applies to the Roman context. This study argues, however, that the apparent continuity is illusory in some important ways and that we have lost sight of some fine distinctions that the Romans made among the rituals they performed. Sacrificium included vegetal and inedible offerings, and it was not the only Roman ritual that had living victims. Roman sacrificium is both less and more than the typical etic notion of sacrifice.","container-title":"The Journal of Roman Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0075435816000319","ISSN":"0075-4358, 1753-528X","language":"en","page":"58-76","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Roman Sacrifice, Inside and Out","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman-studies/article/roman-sacrifice-inside-and-out/24585106EF99A77C65EFB622E34DC22A","volume":"106","author":[{"family":"Schultz","given":"Celia E."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"container-title-short":"JRS"},
  {"id":"Pierattini2019","type":"article-journal","abstract":"The first stone ashlar blocks of Greek architecture, those of the mid-seventh-century temples at Isthmia and Corinth, pose a problem for understanding the beginnings of Greek stone construction.1 Their peculiar feature is the presence of grooves plausibly explained as a way to move the blocks with ropes. Yet scholars disagree about how these ropes would have been used, and during what stage of construction. The first excavators of the two temples suggested that the ropes would have served to lift each block into place, and were subsequently extracted from the grooves once the block had been set against its neighbour. Later scholars dismissed this theory as both inconsistent with the evidence and technically impracticable, questioning whether lifting machines were used in Greek construction as early as the mid-seventh century. Currently, the widely accepted view holds that the crane appeared in the Greek world only in the late sixth century. An alternative hypothesis is that the grooves were cut early in the construction process so that ropes could be used to manoeuvre the blocks within the quarry. However, the ‘lifting’ theory continues to have its adherents. Clarifying the significance of these parallel grooves is thus a matter of some importance to the history of Greek construction. This article reassesses the alternative theses on the basis of a new examination of the evidence, and demonstrates that the idea that the grooves served for lifting is the most plausible. Furthermore, it argues that forerunners of the crane appeared in Greece well before the late sixth century. Finally, by examining how the blocks would have been manoeuvred into place after lifting, it contends that the grooves also served the purpose of placement, with a method anticipating the Classical period's sophisticated lever technique., Ερμηνεύοντας τις αύλακες περίδεσης. Η ανύψωση, η τοποθέτηση και η γένεση της Ελληνικής Μνημειακής αρχιτεκτονικής.Οι πρώτες λιθόπλινθοι της Ελληνικής Αρχιτεκτονικής, των ναών των μέσων του 7ου αιώνα π.Χ. στην Ισθμία και την Κόρινθο, θέτουν ένα πρόβλημα για την κατανόηση των αρχών της λίθινης οικοδομικής. Αυτό το ιδιαίτερο χαρακτηριστικό τους είναι η παρουσία αυλάκων ερμηνευμένων λογικά ως ένα μέσα για μετακίνηση των πλίνθων με σχοινιά. Ωστόσο οι ερευνητές διαφωνούν ως προς τον τρόπο με τον οποίο αυτά τα σχοινιά θα χρησιμοποιούνταν και σε ποιο κατασκευαστικό στάδιο. Οι πρώτοι ανασκαφείς των δύο ναών πρότειναν ότι τα σχοινιά θα εξυπηρετούσαν την ανύψωση κάθε λιθόπλινθου στη θέση της, και ύστερα απομακρύνονταν από τις αυλακώσεις όταν η λιθόπλινθος είχε τοποθετηθεί σε επαφή με τη διπλανή της. Αργότερα ερευνητές απέρριψαν αυτή τη θεωρία τόσο ως αντιφατική με τα τεκμήρια όσο και τεχνικά ανέφικτη, αμφισβητώντας αν ανυψωτικές μηχανές χρησιμοποιούνταν στην αρχαιοελληνική οικοδομική ήδη από τα μέσα του 7ου αι. π.Χ. Επί του παρόντος, η ευρέως αποδεκτή θεωρία υποστηρίζει ότι ο γερανός εμφανίστηκε στον Ελληνικό κόσμο μόνο στον ύστερο 6ο αι. π.Χ. Μια εναλλακτική υπόθεση είναι ότι οι αύλακες ανοίγονταν νωρίς στην κατασκευαστική διαδικασία ώστε να μπορούν να χρησιμοποιηθούν σχοινιά για τη μετακίνηση των λιθόπλινθων μέσα στο λατομείο. Ωστόσο, η «ανυψωτική» θεωρία συνεχίζει να βρίσκει υποστηρικτές. Η διευκρίνηση της σημασίας αυτών των παράλληλων αυλακώσεων είναι έτσι ένα θέμα ιδιαίτερης σπουδαιότητας για την ιστορία της αρχαίας ελληνικής οικοδομικής. Αυτό το άρθρο, επανεκτιμά την εναλλακτική θεωρία με βάση την επανεξέταση των τεκμηρίων, και αποδεικνύει πως η ιδέα ότι οι αύλακες χρησίμευαν για την ανύψωση είναι η πιο εύλογη. Επιπλέον, το άρθρο υποστηρίζει ότι οι πρόδρομοι του γερανού εμφανίστηκαν στην Ελλάδα πολύ πριν τα τέλη του 6ου αι. Τέλος, μέσω της εξέτασης του τρόπου με τον οποίο οι λιθίπλινθοι θα μετακινούνταν στη θέση τους μετά την ανύψωση, διατείνεται ότι οι αύλακες χρησίμευαν επίσης στην τοποθέτηση, με μια μέθοδο που προβλέπει την εκλεπτισμένη τεχνική των μοχλών της Κλασικής περιόδου.Μετάφραση: Στέλιος Ιερεμίας.","container-title":"Annual of the British School at Athens","DOI":"10.1017/S0068245419000030","ISSN":"0068-2454, 2045-2403","language":"en","page":"167-206","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Interpreting rope channels: Lifting, setting and the birth of greek monumental architecture","title-short":"INTERPRETING ROPE CHANNELS","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annual-of-the-british-school-at-athens/article/interpreting-rope-channels-lifting-setting-and-the-birth-of-greek-monumental-architecture/842D9141067E239A94BB72446FA5CA73","volume":"114","author":[{"family":"Pierattini","given":"Alessandro"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11]]}},

  {"id":"Palombi2003","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Recent research carried out during organisation of the Cori Museum (Latina) has resulted in a significant revision and substantial updating of all our knowledge of the ancient city of Cora (Cori), in Latium. The study presented here is an updated and critical report on all the available sources and finds related to the history and the archaeology of the city and its territory, from its origins to medieval times. The analysis considers all these elements, specifically in the context of the history of Latium as a whole and its connections with Rome. With the help of unpublished or little-known information, the following elements are analysed in detail: the city's foundation myth; the important role of the archaic and high-republican city; the urban phases (focussing principally on the earliest organisation, dated to the archaic period, and on the 2nd century B.C. monumental building programme); the local pantheon and the principal sanctuaries; the monuments and the urban buildings; the organisation of the territory; the first evidence of the Christian cult.","archive":"JSTOR","container-title":"Archeologia Classica","ISSN":"0391-8165","page":"197-252","source":"JSTOR","title":"Cora: Bilancio storico e archeologico","title-short":"CORA","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/44367597","volume":"54","author":[{"family":"Palombi","given":"Domenico"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]}},
  {"id":"Caratelli2011","type":"article-journal","abstract":"An imposing building of the Late Republican age, built to support an extensive paved area today called piazza Pozzo Dorico, is still preserved in the centre of the Latin town of Cora, close to the forum. This building is composed of seven rooms with vaulted ceiling built using the opus incertum technique, three of which were used as cisterns while the function of the other four is unknown. The latter give onto a street, today called via Ninfina, and are separated from the bedrock at the back by a narrow cavity wall; they have gone through a an endless series of works and restorations, which are still in progress and which have greatly changed its aspect and functionality. Only two of them still preserve the traces of a fountain, of which only the groove housing the pipe for the water supply and a basin are still in place. This article offers an accurate description and archaeological analysis of the ancient masonry. It also offers-up to-date, albeit partial, documentation of the monument which includes all the other archaeological evidence that, in the light of the building technique used and topographical location, belonged to the same urban plan layout.","archive":"JSTOR","container-title":"Archeologia Classica","ISSN":"0391-8165","page":"413-444","source":"JSTOR","title":"Cori: Le Sostruzioni di Piazza Pozzo Dorico","title-short":"CORI","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/44368093","volume":"62","author":[{"family":"Caratelli","given":"Giovanni"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,14]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"container-title-short":"ArchCl"},

  {"id":"Goffaux2011","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Les fragments de la plaque de marbre opisthographe du sanctuaire des Tours Mirandes à Vendeuvre-du-Poitou (Vienne) ont été mis au jour lors des fouilles sur le site au début des années 1970, sans jamais faire l'objet d'un véritable travail d'édition. La présente étude constitue donc une editio princeps et cherche à reconstituer le texte des deux faces de ce document exceptionnel qui reprend, d'un côté, la dédicace originelle du sanctuaire, faite sans doute à l'époque julio-claudienne, et, de l'autre, un texte commémorant d'importants travaux de réaménagement, probablement effectués dans la seconde moitié du IIe s. ou au début du IIIe s. En dépit de sa conservation très fragmentaire, ce document nous aide à mieux comprendre l'histoire de ce vicus et l'organisation religieuse de la cité des Pictons, en révélant l'implication de notables locaux dans la construction du sanctuaire à différentes époques, et en soulignant la place sans doute occupée par le dieu Apollon dans le panthéon civique. The pieces of a marble opisthograph plaque from the sanctuary at les Tours Mirandes (Vendeuvre-du-Poitou, Vienne) have been uncovered during the excavations carried out on the site in the early seventies, without having been actually published. So in this paper we give the editio princeps and attempt to reconstruct the text of the two sides of this exceptional document: on one side it gives the original dedication of the sanctuary, presumably dating to the Julio-Claudian period, on the other one the commemoration of a vast renovation, probably in the second half of the 2nd century or in the early 3rd century AD. Although fragmentary, this document contributes to a better understanding of the Views' history and of the religious organization in the civitas of the Pictones, showing the involvement of the local elite in the construction and development of the sanctuary and throwing light on the part may be held by the god Apollo in the civic pantheon.","archive":"JSTOR","container-title":"Gallia","ISSN":"0016-4119","issue":"2","page":"253-290","source":"JSTOR","title":"La double dédicace du sanctuaire des Tours Mirandes (Vendeuvre-du-Poitou, Vienne) dans la cité des Pictons","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/43616900","volume":"68","author":[{"family":"Goffaux","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Hiernard","given":"Jean"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,15]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]}},
