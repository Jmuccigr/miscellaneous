# Pussyhats

Here's my version of a iconic pussyhat, worn by tens of thousands at the January 21, 2017 women's marches across the country and the world. The original is a vector-based SVG, but I've also created some square PNGs from that. Feel free to use! (And get in touch if you want to use it on a commercial project.)
